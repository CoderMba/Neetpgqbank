Explanation: Apoptosis (Caspase dependent programmed cell death):   It is an active process.   It eliminates cells that are injured beyond repair without eliciting a host reaction, thus limiting collateral tissue damage.   Apoptosis results from the activation of enzymes called caspases leading to DNA fragmentation.   The process of apoptosis may be divided into an initiation phase , during which caspases9 (intrinsic pathway), 8,10 (extrinsic pathway) become catalytically active and unleash a cascade of other caspases, and an execution phase , during which the terminal caspases 3,6,7 trigger cellular fragmentation.

        "solution": "Correct answer. D) Fas Ligand Explanation : Fas ligand is a component of Apoptosis and not efferocytosis. Efferocytosis:   The apoptotic bodies give the eat-me signals, which are expressed as C1q, Thrombospondin, and PS (Phosphatidyl Serine).   In the normal cell, the Phosphatidyl Serine is present in the inner leaflet, but in the apoptotic cell, it comes out. This is known as Phosphatidyl Serine Flipping (Defective in Scott syndrome).   This is known as Phosphatidyl Serine Flipping (Defective in Scott syndrome).   Based on this flipping, the Macrophage engulfs the apoptotic bodies, which is called Efferocytosis.   Efferocytosis involves macrophages, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts.   The term \"efferosome\" refers to a fluid-filled membrane vesicle that engulfs dead cells.   It works in coordination with apoptosis because efferosomes engulf apoptotic cells before they are bleached out.   Defects in efferocytosis are seen in SLE, cystic fibrosis, COPD, etc.   This is known as Phosphatidyl Serine Flipping (Defective in Scott syndrome). Note : Cancer cells express CD47 to Macrophages. CD47 is a \"Do not Eat me\" signal."

        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Telomerase prevents the shortening of telomeres by adding DNA sequences to the ends of chromosomes, thus potentially extending cells' lifespan. Explanation: Telomerase, also known as the immortality gene, is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme that adds DNA sequences to the ends of chromosomes, preventing telomere shortening during cell division.   Thousands of telomeres are present at the ends of chromosomes from human birth; by maintaining telomere length with each cell division, telomerase has the potential to extend a cell’s lifespan. (Option A ruled out)   It is expressed most in germ cells and is present at low levels in stem cells, but it is absent in most of the somatic cells. (Option B ruled out)   Telomerase is a Ribonucleoprotein(RNA containing enzyme) not a Ribozyme(RNA has enzymatic activity) In Telomerase RNA only acts as a template for DNA synthesis (Option D ruled out)   In cancer cells, the telomerase is usually reactivated, and telomere length gets stabilized, allowing the cells to proliferate indefinitely."

        "answer": 4,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: D) It represents the maximum number of times a cell can divide before experiencing replicative senescence. Explanation: The Hayflick limit or Hayflick’s phenomenon represents the number of cell divisions a cell undergoes before reaching its replicative senescence.   It reflects the limited proliferative capacity of cells due to factors such as telomere shortening.   Somatic cells typically undergo around 40 to 60 divisions before entering a state of replicative senescence.

        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) It is a reversible change in which one adult cell type is replaced by another adult cell type Explanation:   Metaplasia is a reversible process in which one adult cell type is replaced by another, typically in response to chronic irritation or inflammation.   Metaplasia is a change in the phenotype of differentiated cells, often in response to chronic irritation, that makes cells better able to withstand stress.   It is usually induced by an altered differentiation pathway of tissue stem cells and may result in reduced functions or an increased propensity for malignant transformation (Option A ruled out).   It often represents an adaptive response in which one cell type that is sensitive to a particular stress is replaced by another cell type that is better able to withstand the adverse environment.   Signals generated by cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix components in the cells’ environment stimulate the metaplastic change."

        },
        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Option C - Decreased telomere length is associated with ageing:   Telomerase theory of ageing: Cellular ageing and the emergence of age-related disorders are linked to the steady shortening of telomeres.   The telomerase enzyme may prolong telomeres, but as people age, its activity decreases.   Telomeres can no longer shield the chromosome from harm as they get shorter and reach a critical length, which causes cell death.   Telomere length loss is linked to aging and diseases of the elderly. Incorrect Options: Option A - Telomere stability is associated with ageing: Telomere stability is not associated with ageing as telomere length shortens with age. This progressive shortening of telomeres causes senescence, apoptosis, or oncogenic transformation of somatic cells, thereby impacting the health and lifespan of an individual. Option B - Abnormal telomerase activation is associated with ageing: Telomerase adds nucleotides to the telomere of the chromosome and keeps them alive, thereby slowing the ageing process. Option D - Increased telomere length is associated with ageing: Increasing telomere length helps in maintaining healthy cells, decreases apoptosis and senescence, and slows the ageing process."

        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Impaired phagocytosis Explanation:   In cases of severe infection or in the presence of large pathogen loads, the process of phagocytosis may become ineffective, resulting in incomplete or impaired phagocytosis which is known as ‘Frustrated Phagocytosis.’   In the clinical scenario described, the presence of cavitary lesions in the lung parenchyma is most likely associated with impaired phagocytosis, where phagocytes are unable to effectively clear pathogens or cellular debris.   This impaired phagocytosis can lead to tissue damage and necrosis, contributing to the formation of cavitary lesions. Examples of Frustrated Phagocytosis:   Glomerulonephritis : Immune complexes deposited in glomeruli trigger enzyme release, causing kidney damage.   Foreign Bodies : Large materials like asbestos or surgical sutures resist engulfment, leading to chronic inflammation.   Granulomas (Tuberculosis): Persistent mycobacteria in granulomas cause phagocyte-mediated tissue destruction.   Parasites : Large parasites like Schistosoma trigger eosinophil and macrophage degranulation, damaging tissues.   Atherosclerosis : Macrophages release toxic mediators in response to unengulfable cholesterol crystals, worsening plaque inflammation.

        },
        "answer": 4,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: D) NETs directly phagocytose the invading pathogens. Explanation: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular fibrillar networks that concentrate antimicrobial substances at sites of infection and trap microbes, helping to prevent their spread.   NETs do not directly phagocytose or engulf the invading pathogens (Option D) . Instead, they trap pathogens within their structure, immobilizing them and allowing other immune cells, such as macrophages, to recognize and eliminate them.   They are produced by neutrophils in response to infectious pathogens (mainly bacteria and fungi) and inflammatory mediators (e.g., chemokines, cytokines, complement proteins, and ROS). (Option A)   NET formation starts with ROS-dependent activation of an arginine deaminase that converts arginines to citrulline, leading to chromatin decondensation.   NETs are composed of nuclear chromatin and various granule proteins, including antimicrobial peptides and enzymes that help to neutralize and kill pathogens trapped within the NETs. (Option B)   Activated neutrophils release histones into the extracellular space which helps to unwind and release the DNA, allowing it to combine with granule proteins and form the characteristic web-like structure of NETs. (Option C)   They have been detected in conditions like sepsis, emphasizing their importance in immune protection.   The nuclear chromatin in the NETs, which includes histones and associated DNA, has been postulated to be a source of nuclear antigens in systemic autoimmune diseases, particularly lupus, in which individuals react against their own DNA and nucleoproteins.

        },
        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Microbial engulfment Explanation:   Microbial engulfment refers to the process by which phagocytes engulf and internalize pathogens for destruction.   Opsonization plays a critical role in this process by coating pathogens with opsonins, that enhance phagocytosis.   Reduced opsonization activity in serum directly impacts microbial engulfment, as pathogens are less efficiently recognized and phagocytosed by immune cells. Opsonins are substances that coat pathogens or foreign particles, making them more recognizable and easier for phagocytic cells to engulf.   They act as \"handles\" that bind to both the pathogen and the receptor on the phagocyte.   Opsonin is divided into 3 Categories: IgG (Most important opsonin) Complement proteins (C 3b , C 4b , C 5b ): The most important complement opsonin C 3b Plasma Protein (E.g., Fibrinogen)   IgG (Most important opsonin)   Complement proteins (C 3b , C 4b , C 5b ): The most important complement opsonin C 3b   Plasma Protein (E.g., Fibrinogen)   IgG (Most important opsonin)   Complement proteins (C 3b , C 4b , C 5b ): The most important complement opsonin C 3b   Plasma Protein (E.g., Fibrinogen) Opsonization is the process through which opsonins mark foreign particles for destruction by phagocytes. It involves the following steps:   Binding of opsonins to the surface of the pathogen. For example, antibodies or complement proteins like C3b bind to antigens or microbial surfaces.   For example, antibodies or complement proteins like C3b bind to antigens or microbial surfaces.   Recognition by phagocytes : Phagocytes have receptors (e.g., Fc receptors for antibodies, complement receptors for C3b) that specifically bind to opsonins. This allows the phagocyte to recognize the pathogen more efficiently.   Phagocytes have receptors (e.g., Fc receptors for antibodies, complement receptors for C3b) that specifically bind to opsonins.   This allows the phagocyte to recognize the pathogen more efficiently.   Phagocytosis : The phagocyte engulfs the opsonized pathogen, internalizing it in a phagosome. The pathogen is then killed and digested by enzymes within the phagocyte.   The phagocyte engulfs the opsonized pathogen, internalizing it in a phagosome.   The pathogen is then killed and digested by enzymes within the phagocyte.   For example, antibodies or complement proteins like C3b bind to antigens or microbial surfaces.

Purulent inflammation is characterized by the production of pus, an exudate consisting of neutrophils, the liquefied debris of necrotic cells, and oedema fluid.   Abscesses are localized collections of pus caused by suppuration buried in tissue, organ, or confined space. Serous inflammation (Option A) Accumulation of fluid in body cavities is called an effusion, which can occur due to increased vascular permeability or local irritation. Fibrinous inflammation (Option B) Fibrinous inflammation involves the deposition of fibrin in the extracellular space due to increased vascular permeability.Histologically, fibrin appears as an eosinophilic meshwork of threads or an amorphous coagulum. Ulcerative inflammation (Option D) Ulcerative inflammation involves local defects or excavations of an organ or tissue's surface caused by the shedding of inflamed necrotic tissue, which is common in mucosal surfaces, the skin, and subcutaneous tissues."

It typically appears firm, raised, and extends beyond the margins of the initial injury.   Keloid formation seems to be an individual predisposition, and it is more common in African Americans.   Sternum is the most common site for Keloid formation.   Treatment can be done by intralesional injection of steroids like Triamcinolone. Hypertrophic scar : (option A) While hypertrophic scars are also raised, they typically remain within the boundaries of the original injury. They may regress over time and are less likely to recur after treatment compared to keloids. Exuberant granulation tissue(Option C) Exuberant granulation tissue, also known as proud flesh, refers to excessive amounts of granulation tissue, which protrudes above the level of the surrounding skin and blocks reepithelialization. Contracture(Option D) Contractures occur when scar tissue forms and tightens, leading to restricted movement of nearby joints or tissues. They typically occur in case of burns or deep wounds.

In COPD exacerbations, increased levels of CXCL8 are observed in the airways, contributing to the recruitment and activation of neutrophils, which exacerbate airway inflammation and tissue damage. MCP-1(OPTION B): monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), primarily recruits monocytes and macrophages to sites of inflammation. It is not primarily responsible for recruiting neutrophils to the airways during exacerbations SDF-1(OPTION C): CXCL12, also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), is involved in stem cell homing and lymphocyte trafficking. It primarily attracts lymphocytes, monocytes, and hematopoietic stem cells but is not a major chemokine involved in recruiting neutrophils to the airways in COPD exacerbations. RANTES(OPTION D): CCL5, also known as regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), attracts T cells, eosinophils, and basophils to sites of inflammation. While it contributes to the inflammatory response, it is not primarily responsible for recruiting neutrophils to the airways in COPD exacerbations."

        },
        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Cycloxygenase (COX) 1 and COX-2 inhibition Explanation:   Arachidonic acid (AA), derived from phospholipids, is metabolized by cyclooxygenases (COX-1, COX-2) to form prostanoids (prostaglandins, thromboxane).   COX-1 is a constitutive enzyme, predominantly involved in various homeostatic mechanisms in the body, while COX-2 is predominantly involved in inflammation.   Prostaglandins are responsible for vasodilation (PGD2, PGI2) and pain (PGE2) in inflammation.   Naproxen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The predominant action of NSAIDs is via COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition, resulting in analgesia and anti-inflammatory effects which is required in this case of musculoskeletal injury..   One major adverse effect of NSAIDs is gastric irritation, including ulcers and bleeding. This occurs due to the loss of gastroprotective PGs i.e. PGE2 formed by COX-1. Thus, in patients with previous history of gastric ulcers, selective COX-2 inhibitors may be used - celecoxib, etoricoxib, etc.   Lipoxygenase acts on AA to form leukotrienes. Leukotrienes have clinical significance in atopy and mediate anaphylaxis and bronchoconstriction. Zileuton (LOX inhibitor) and montelukast (LT receptor antagonists) are therefore used in asthma and allergic rhinitis but have no anti-inflammatory action (Option A).   PGF2 is a prostanoid formed by cyclooxygenase. However, it has no role in inflammation. Rather, it causes smooth muscle contraction. Thus PGF2alpha analogue (carboprost) may be used to induce labor or as an abortifacient (Option D)"

        "solution": "CORRECT ANSWER: C) Deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor EXPLANATION: The clinical presentation of the patient with sudden-onset swelling of her face, lips, and tongue with similar episodes in the past, triggered by stress and trauma is suggestive of hereditary angioneurotic edema. It is caused due to deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor Hereditary angioneurotic edema is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of non-pitting, non-pruritic swelling of the skin and mucous membranes.   C1INH (C1 esterase inhibitor) blocks the catalytic function of C1.   Deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor leads to elevated plasma levels of bradykinin leading to angioedema, and excessive activation of C1 results in a decline in plasma C4 and C2 levels.   Swelling in HAE commonly affects areas such as the face, lips, tongue, throat, and extremities and can lead to airway compromise if it involves the upper respiratory tract.

        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "CORRECT ANSWER: B) CD59 EXPLANATION: A clinical presentation of a patient with hemoglobinuria, pallor, jaundice, anemia, elevated LDH, and flow cytometry showing deficiency of certain proteins on the surface of red blood cells would be suggestive of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), which is due to the deficiency of CD59.   PNH is a rare acquired hematologic disorder characterized by a mutation of the PIG-A gene .   This mutation results in a deficiency of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)- anchored proteins on the surface of blood cells.   This deficiency leads to the absence of important complement regulatory proteins, such as CD55 aka DAF (decay accelerating factor) and CD59 aka RIML (reactive inhibitor of membrane lysis) , which normally protect red blood cells from complement-mediated destruction.   Consequently, red blood cells become sensitive to lysis by the complement system , particularly during periods of physical stress or following sleep.   PNH is characterized by a triad of hemolysis + pancytopenia + venous thrombosis.   Other symptoms include hemoglobinuria, fatigue, pallor, jaundice, abdominal pain, and recurrent infections.   Flow cytometry (the gold standard for diagnosis): Shows the absence of CD55 and CD59.

        "answer": 4,
        "solution": "CORRECT ANSWER: D) Bradykinin EXPLANATION: Bradykinin mediates pain during an inflammatory response   Bradykinin is produced from the cleavage of high-molecular-weight kininogen by the action of kallikrein.   It is a potent mediator of inflammation and pain , released in response to tissue injury and trauma .   It acts on its receptors to induce vasodilation , increase vascular permeability , and stimulate the release of other inflammatory mediators.   These actions contribute to the characteristic signs of inflammation, including redness, swelling, heat, and pain.   Additionally, bradykinin can directly activate nociceptors (pain-sensing neurons), leading to the sensation of pain.   The action of bradykinin is short-lived because it is quickly inactivated by an enzyme called kininase.   Bradykinin has been implicated as a mediator in some forms of allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis. (S er ot o ni n) ( O pt io n A)Serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) , is a neurotransmitter and vasoactive substance produced primarily by enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract. It regulates mood, appetite , and sleep , as well as gastrointestinal motility and platelet aggregation . In the context of inflammation, serotonin released from platelets and mast cells can contribute to vasodilation , increased vascular permeability, and smooth muscle contraction . Its role in inflammation is less prominent compared to other mediators like histamine and bradykinin. (L e u k ot ri e n e s) ( O pt io n B)Leukotrienes are lipid mediators synthesized from arachidonic acid metabolism, primarily by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway.

A missense mutation (type of point mutation) is the underlying mechanism in the pathogenesis of this disease. Point mutation:   A point mutation is a change in which a single base is substituted with a different base.   Types: Missen se mut ationIt can be: Sickle cell anaemia. This point mutation involves substituting adenine for thymine at the sixth codon of the β-globin gene (GAG to GTG) , replacing glutamic acid with valine in the β-globin chain of haemoglobin. This single nucleotide change results in the formation of abnormal haemoglobin molecules (HbS) . Nonse nse mu tation (Option D)Change of an amino acid to a chain terminator or stop codon. (UAA, UGA, UAG) Example: Beta thalassemia This change leads to premature termination of β-globin gene translation, and the short peptide that is produced is rapidly degraded. Chromosomal translocation (Option A) involves the exchange of genetic material between non-homologous chromosomes. E.g. Chronic myeloid leukemia- t(9;22). A frameshift mutation (Option C) is a type of genetic mutation that results from the insertion or deletion of nucleotides in a DNA sequence, causing a shift in the reading frame during translation.

        },
        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct answer: C) Pseudodominance Explanation : Pseudodominance occurs when a recessive allele appears to be expressed in the heterozygous condition due to the limited number of crossovers between linked genes.   In pseudo dominance, a heterozygous individual (carrier) for a recessive allele exhibits the phenotype of the homozygous recessive individual due to the absence or inactivation of the dominant allele.   In this scenario, the patient's maternal grandmother is a carrier of the hemophilia A gene and has one normal X chromosome and one X chromosome with the mutated gene.   If the normal X chromosome is preferentially inactivated in her cells, she may exhibit the phenotype of hemophilia A, even though she is heterozygous for the condition. This phenomenon results in the appearance of hemophilia A in her descendants, leading to pseudo-dominance. Another example of pseudo-dominance is red-green colour blindness."

It is the most common mode of inheritance. (Option D)   Both males and females are affected, and both can transmit the condition. (Option A)   They are characterized by: With every autosomal dominant disorder, some proportion of patients do not have affected parents. Clinical features can be modified by variations in penetrance and expressivity: Some individuals inherit the mutant gene but are phenotypically normal. This is referred to as incomplete penetrance . (Option C) If a trait is seen in all individuals carrying the mutant gene but is expressed differently among individuals, the phenomenon is called variable expressivity.

        "solution": "Correct answer: D) Autosomal Recessive Inheritance, Mutation in the GBA Gene Explanation : Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by mutations in the glucocerebrosidase - GBA1 gene. Three clinical subtypes of Gaucher disease have been distinguished:   Type I: Chronic non-neuronopathic form.   Type II: Acute neuronopathic form, also known as infantile acute cerebral pattern.   Type III: Intermediate between types I and II. MORPHOLOGY:   In Gaucher disease, glucocerebrosides accumulate massively within phagocytic cells throughout the body, forming distended cells known as Gaucher cells.   These cells, found in various organs including the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and lungs, exhibit a fibrillar cytoplasm resembling crumpled tissue paper.

Type A is a severe infantile form with extensive neurologic involvement, marked visceral accumulations of sphingomyelin, progressive wasting and early death within the first 3 years of life.   In contrast, patients with type B disease have organomegaly but generally no central nervous system involvement. Patients usually survive into adulthood.

Affected mothers and daughters transmit the disease to both male and female children, whereas the affected sons don't transmit the affected DNA. (Mother to all, Father to none.)   The most common mitochondrial disease is MELAS.   The most common mitochondrial Myopathy is CPEO (chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia) Gonadal mosaicism   A genetic condition where a mutation is present in the ovaries or testes, but not in other cells of the body.   This can cause a parent to pass on a genetic condition to their children without developing it themselves.

        },
        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct answer: C) Pleiotropy Explanation: A single mutant gene leading to many end effects is called pleiotropism , whereas mutations at several genetic loci producing a similar phenotypic effect are called genetic heterogeneity.   Sickle cell anemia is an example of pleiotropy with a single gene mutation causing multiple physical effects.   The mutation produces hemoglobin S (HbS) , which makes red blood cells prone to hemolysis.   Additionally, it can lead to complications like splenic fibrosis, organ infarcts, and bone pains.   All these diverse effects on different organs stem from the initial issue of HbS production. Variable penetrance (Option B) refers to a condition where individuals inherit the mutant gene but are phenotypically normal. Variable expressivity (Option A) refers to the phenomenon where individuals with the same genetic mutation display different levels and types of symptoms or traits.   For example, with Marfan syndrome, one person might experience primarily skeletal issues while another could have serious cardiovascular problems, but all these are due to a single primary defect i.e. mutation in the gene FBN1 encoding fibrillin-1."

        "solution": "CORRECT ANSWER: D)Autosomal recessive EXPLANATION: The progressive difficulty with coordination and balance in both siblings, along with the maternal uncle's being affected, suggests Friedreich's ataxia (A repeat expansion of the trinucleotide GAA (guanine-adenine-adenine), typically in the gene's first intron, is the leading cause of this disease) a pattern consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. In this scenario, both parents are likely carriers of a defective gene responsible for Friedreich's ataxia, and each sibling has inherited two copies of the defective gene , resulting in the development of this disorder. Autosomal recessive inheritance:   Autosomal recessive disorders require both copies of the gene (one from each parent) to be affected for the condition to manifest.   Horizontal transmission: The trait appears in siblings and parents are normal.   History of consanguineous marriage: The parents are blood-related. Both the couple are carriers of abnormal genes.   25% chance of having an affected child (double dose of abnormal gene) in a carrier couple.   Early age of onset and complete penetrance are common.

        "solution": "CORRECT ANSWER: D) EXPLANATION: The clinical presentation, along with the family history of sudden vision loss in multiple maternal relatives, is highly suggestive of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) , a maternally inherited mitochondrial disorder affecting the optic nerves. Mitochondrial inheritance:   A unique feature of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is maternal inheritance.   This peculiarity exists because ova contain numerous mitochondria within their abundant cytoplasm, whereas spermatozoa contain few, if any.   Hence the mtDNA complement of the zygote is derived entirely from the ovum.   Thus, mothers transmit mtDNA to all their offspring , male and female.   Daughters transmit the DNA to their further progeny.   Properties: mtDNA encodes enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation , mutations affecting these genes exert their deleterious effects primarily on the organs most dependent on oxidative phosphorylation such as the central nervous system, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, liver, and kidneys. Each mitochondrion contains thousands of copies of mtDNA, and typically, deleterious mutations affect some, but not all, of these copies. Thus, tissues and individuals may harbor both wild-type and mutant mtDNA, which is known as heteroplasmy. A minimum number of mutant mtDNAs must be present in a cell or tissue before oxidative dysfunction causes disease. This is called the threshold effect. Mitochondria and their contained DNA are randomly distributed to the daughter cells during cell division. Thus when a cell containing normal and mutant mtDNA divides, the proportion of the normal and mutant mtDNA in daughter cells is extremely variable. Therefore the expression of disorders resulting from mutations in mtDNA is quite variable.   mtDNA encodes enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation , mutations affecting these genes exert their deleterious effects primarily on the organs most dependent on oxidative phosphorylation such as the central nervous system, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, liver, and kidneys.

        "solution": "CORRECT ANSWER: B) Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) EXPLANATION:   FISH uses DNA probes that recognize sequences specific to particular chromosomal regions.   In the case of HER2 testing, FISH directly visualizes HER2 gene amplification by labelling the HER2 gene with a fluorescent probe.   HER2 protein overexpression is virtually always caused by amplification of the region of chromosome 17q that contains the HER2 gene.   The increase in HER2 gene copy number is detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization using a HER2-specific probe (red signal), which is typically co-hybridized to tumour cell nuclei with a second probe specific for the centromeric region of chromosome 17 (green signal), allowing the chromosome 17 copy number to be determined.

        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer : B) Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) Explanation: Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic technique used to detect copy number variations (CNVs) in the genome, including microdeletions and microduplications. It involves comparing the patient's DNA with a reference DNA sample, often labelled with different fluorescent dyes, to identify gains or losses of genetic material. Schematic for Comparative Genomic Hybridization : Uses of Comparative Genomic Hybridization:   Detection of Copy Number Variations (CNVs) : Identifies gains and losses of DNA segments.   Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders : Detects chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., microdeletions, microduplications) linked to developmental and congenital disorders (e.g., Williams, DiGeorge syndrome).   Cancer Genomics : Identifies chromosomal imbalances in cancer cells, including gene amplifications or deletions (e.g., in breast cancer, and gliomas).   Prenatal Screening : Detects chromosomal abnormalities in fetuses, such as Down syndrome and other congenital defects.   Assessment of Structural Variations : Identifies larger structural changes (e.g., duplications, deletions, inversions, translocations).   Neurodevelopmental Disorders : Identifies CNVs linked to conditions like autism spectrum disorders.   Genomic Research : Provides insights into the genetic basis of diseases by identifying recurrent CNVs in patient populations.   Personalized Medicine : Identifies genetic alterations that guide targeted therapies, particularly in cancer. PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is used for amplifying specific DNA sequences and is not specifically designed to detect CNVs. (Option A) DNA sequencing: DNA sequencing is used to determine the precise order of nucleotides in a DNA molecule and is not primarily focused on detecting CNVs. (Option C) Southern blotting: Southern blotting is a technique used to detect specific DNA sequences, often related to gene expression or mutations, but it is not tailored for CNV detection.

        },
        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Option A - Autosomal Dominant Inheritance:   In autosomal dominant inheritance, a single copy of the mutated gene from one parent is enough to cause the trait or disorder.   The trait or disorder will be present in every generation, as affected individuals pass the mutated gene to their offspring.   Individuals with one affected parent have a 50% chance of inheriting the trait.   For example, if a parent has a dominant genetic disorder like Huntington's disease, there's a 50% chance their child will inherit the disorder. Incorrect Options: Option B - Autosomal Recessive Inheritance:   In autosomal recessive inheritance, two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) are required to manifest the trait or disorder.   Carriers of a single mutated gene are usually healthy but can pass on the mutation to their offspring.   The trait or disorder might skip generations if carriers do not have affected children.   When two carriers have a child, there's a 25% chance the child will have the disorder, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of having neither the disorder nor being a carrier.   An example is cystic fibrosis. Option C - X-Linked Dominant Inheritance:   X-linked dominant inheritance involves a mutated gene on the X chromosome.   A single copy of the mutated gene on one of the X chromosomes is sufficient to cause the trait or disorder in females (since they have two X chromosomes) and in males (who have one X chromosome).   Affected fathers pass the disorder to all their daughters, but not to their sons.   Affected mothers have a 50% chance of passing the disorder to both sons and daughters.   An example is Rett syndrome. Option D - X-Linked Recessive Inheritance:   X-linked recessive inheritance also involves a mutated gene on the X chromosome.   Males are more commonly affected because they have only one X chromosome.   Carrier mothers (with one normal and one mutated X chromosome) can pass the mutation to their sons (who get their X chromosome from the mother) and to half of their daughters (who inherit the mutated X chromosome).   Carrier fathers pass the mutated gene only to their daughters, who become carriers.   An example is color blindness."

        "options": {
          "A": "100%",
          "B": "50%",
          "C": "75%",
          "D": "25%"
        },
        "answer": 4,
        "solution": "Correct Option D - 25%:   When both parents are carriers of the thalassemia trait (heterozygous), the Punnett square analysis shows that there's a 25% chance for their offspring to inherit two mutated copies of the gene (one from each parent), resulting in thalassemia. There is a 50% chance of inheriting one normal and one mutated gene (being a carrier like the parents), and a 25% chance of inheriting two normal copies of the gene. Incorrect Options: Option A - 100%: This would mean that all of their offspring would definitely have thalassemia, which is not the case. Thalassemia is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, meaning that both copies of the gene need to carry the mutation for the disorder to manifest. Since both parents have thalassemia trait, they each carry one normal copy of the gene and one mutated copy. Therefore, there is a chance that their offspring may inherit one normal copy from one parent and one mutated copy from the other, resulting in carrying the thalassemia trait, but not necessarily having thalassemia. Option B - 50%: This would imply that each offspring has a 50% chance of having thalassemia. While it's true that each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene from either parent, the probability of them having thalassemia depends on both copies of the gene being mutated, which is less likely. Option C - 75%: This would suggest that there's a higher likelihood of having thalassemia than not. However, the probability of an offspring having thalassemia is not this high. It's important to remember that the trait they both have is the heterozygous form (thalassemia trait), which means they each have one normal gene and one mutated gene. This significantly reduces the probability of their offspring having thalassemia"

        },
        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Option A - Autosomal Recessive:   Consanguinity refers to a close blood relationship between the parents.   Autosomal recessive diseases are more likely to occur in the offspring of consanguineous couples.   This is because the parents may both carry a single copy of a recessive gene mutation, and when they have children together, there is an increased chance of both parents passing on the mutated gene, resulting in the expression of the disease phenotype in the offspring. Incorrect Options: Option B - Autosomal Dominant:   Autosomal dominant diseases can occur in the offspring of consanguineous couples, but they are not specifically associated with consanguinity.   Autosomal dominant diseases can also arise from de novo mutations or occur in non-consanguineous families. Option C - X-Linked Recessive:   X-linked recessive diseases are inherited through the X chromosome.   Although consanguinity can increase the likelihood of inheriting X-linked recessive diseases, it is not the characteristic pattern associated with consanguinity.

        "solution": "Correct Option A - PML-RARA:   ATRA is a medication derived from vitamin A and is used as a differentiation therapy in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).   APL is characterized by the presence of the PML-RARA fusion gene, resulting from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17 [t(15;17)].   This translocation fuses the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene on chromosome 15 with the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene on chromosome 17.   The PML-RARA fusion protein blocks the normal differentiation of myeloid cells and contributes to leukemogenesis.   ATRA acts by binding to the RARA portion of the fusion protein, promoting the differentiation of leukemic cells into mature granulocytes.

        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Option A - Rett Syndrome:   Rett syndrome is a rare genetic disorder inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern.   Rett syndrome primarily affects females, although in rare cases, it can affect males as well.   It is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene, which is responsible for producing a protein that is essential for the normal development of the brain.   The loss of function of this protein leads to a disruption in the development of the nervous system, resulting in the characteristic symptoms of the disorder.   The symptoms of Rett syndrome typically appear around 6-18 months of age and can include a loss of developmental milestones, a loss of purposeful hand movements, a loss of speech, and the development of repetitive hand movements.   Other features of the syndrome can include breathing irregularities, seizures, scoliosis, and cognitive impairment.   Rett syndrome is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern; affected mothers have a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each of their children. Incorrect Options: Option B - Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy:   Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an inherited disorder that is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which is located on the X chromosome.

        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Option C - Centromeric:   The centromeric pattern is characterized by staining around the centromeric region of chromosomes.   This pattern is associated with autoantibodies targeting centromere proteins, particularly centromere protein B (CENP-B).   It is most commonly seen in limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis, or CREST syndrome. Incorrect Options: Option A - Nucleolar:   The nucleolar pattern refers to the staining of autoantibodies within the nucleoli, which are specialized structures inside the nucleus involved in ribosome biogenesis.   This pattern is often associated with autoantibodies targeting nucleolar antigens, such as fibrillarin, nucleolin, or nucleophosmin.   The nucleolar pattern is frequently seen in autoimmune conditions like systemic sclerosis and mixed connective tissue disease. Option B - Speckled:   The speckled pattern appears as multiple discrete speckles throughout the nucleus.   It is the most common ANA pattern and can be associated with a variety of autoantibodies targeting different nuclear antigens.   Examples of speckled pattern-related autoantibodies include antibodies against extractable nuclear antigens (ENA), such as Smith (Sm), ribonucleoprotein (RNP), and Sjögren's syndrome-related antigens (SSA/SSB).   The speckled pattern can be found in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome, and other autoimmune conditions. Option D - Diffuse:   The diffuse pattern refers to a uniform distribution of staining throughout the nucleus.   It is often a non-specific finding and does not indicate a specific autoimmune disease or autoantibody.   The diffuse pattern can be seen in various autoimmune diseases as well as in non-autoimmune conditions."

Depending on their potency, stem cells can give rise to a wide range of specialized cells in the body. Option B - They can replicate:   Stem cells can undergo self-renewal through replication.   This means they can produce identical copies of themselves during cell division, ensuring the maintenance of a stem cell population. Option D - They can regenerate damaged tissues:   Stem cells play a crucial role in tissue regeneration and repair.   They have the ability to differentiate into the specific cell types needed for tissue repair and can replace damaged or lost cells."

        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Metaplasia Explanation:   In this scenario, the replacement of squamous epithelium with columnar epithelium in the lower oesophagus is consistent with metaplasia, likely due to chronic gastroesophageal reflux (AKA Barrett’s esophagus).   Metaplasia is defined as the replacement of one type of cell with another, often occurring in response to tissue damage, repair, chronic irritation, or regeneration.   This adaptive change aims to suit the altered local environment better.   Examples: Barrett Esophagus Respiratory Epithelium (Smokers' Lung) Cervical Metaplasia Gastric Mucosa in Chronic Gastritis Bladder Metaplasia (Squamous Metaplasia)   Barrett Esophagus   Respiratory Epithelium (Smokers' Lung)   Cervical Metaplasia   Gastric Mucosa in Chronic Gastritis   Bladder Metaplasia (Squamous Metaplasia)   Barrett Esophagus   Respiratory Epithelium (Smokers' Lung)   Cervical Metaplasia   Gastric Mucosa in Chronic Gastritis   Bladder Metaplasia (Squamous Metaplasia) Fe at ur eMetaplasia Dysplasia (Option B)Anaplasia (Option C) De fini tio nReplacement of one cell type by another that adapts to new stress.Disordered, precancerous epithelial cell growth.Loss of differentiation, where cells become more primitive and undifferentiate d.

Tendency to permeate the site of origin making it difficult for surgical excision. Rapid growth rate (Option A): The rapid growth rate is a feature of malignant tumors, not benign tumors which grow slowly and localized to the site of origin. Presence of extracellular matrix (ECM) deposited by stromal cells (Option B): Benign tumours usually has a capsule, which consists of an extracellular matrix (ECM) deposited by stromal cells such as fibroblasts. Since hemangioma is unencapsulated, it is not associated with the deposition of extracellular matrix by stromal cells.

        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Also helpful in identifying metastasis in Melanoma. Explanation: The Sentinel lymph node, the first lymph node to receive metastatic cells from a primary tumour, not a secondary tumour (Option A).   The sentinel lymph node is identified and removed using specialized techniques during surgery, such as lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy.   Sentinel lymph node biopsy is commonly performed in various cancers, including breast cancer and melanoma, to determine the extent of disease spread.   This procedure aids in the staging of the carcinoma for planning treatment.   The presence of cancer cells in a lymph node indicates a more advanced stage of cancer and is generally associated with a poorer prognosis (Option D).   ‘Skip metastasis’ is a pattern of cancer spread where tumour cells bypass the sentinel lymph node and directly metastasize to more distant lymph nodes or other organs (Option C)."

        },
        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) UV-B radiation Explanation:   UV-B radiation is the major cause of sunburn and skin cancer. These medium wavelengths (280-320 nm) primarily affect the outer layers of the skin and are highly mutagenic.   It is responsible for inducing the formation of pyrimidine dimers within DNA, leading to mutations that can result in various types of skin cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma.   Fair-skinned individuals are at higher risk. UV-A radiation (Option A): UV-A rays are longer wavelengths (320-400 nm) and penetrate deeper into the skin. They primarily cause skin ageing. UV-A radiation, particularly in combination with UV-B, can increase the risk of skin cancer. UV-C radiation (Option C) These shorter wavelengths (200-280 nm) are extremely potent in terms of DNA damage, but they are largely filtered out by the Earth's ozone layer and do not reach the surface in significant amounts. UV-D radiation (Option D): The UV spectrum typically consists of UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C and no UV-D radiation."

          "D": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia"
        },
        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Acute Myeloid Leukemia Explanation: Due to prolonged exposure to ionising radiation the patient is at an increased risk of developing Acute Myeloid Leukemia (M/C cancer in individuals with exposure to ionising radiation).   Ionising radiation, which includes electromagnetic (x-rays, γ rays) and particulate (α particles, β particles, protons, neutrons) radiations, is carcinogenic.   It can cause cancer by directly damaging cellular DNA, leading to mutations that disrupt normal gene function and structure.   Leukaemia often has a relatively short latent period, typically around 7 years or less after exposure to certain factors like radiation or chemicals. Solid tumours like breast, colon, thyroid, and lung cancers generally have longer latent periods compared to leukaemia. Pancreatic cancer (Option B):   Risk of Pancreatic cancer is more associated with cigarette smoking, heavy alcohol drinking, obesity, and diet (high intake of saturated fat and/or meat, particularly smoked or processed meats). Medullary thyroid cancer (Option C):   Medullary thyroid cancer is primarily associated with genetic factors, specifically mutations in the RET proto-oncogene, rather than radiation exposure.   However, the risk of Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid and Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid have a high association with radiation exposure. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (Option D): Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the only leukaemia not associated with radiation exposure."

        "answer": 4,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: D) High-risk 16, 18 Explanation: The abnormal cells in the pap smear and biopsy are known as Koilocytes characterised by a raisinoid nucleus and a perinuclear halo, which indicates HPV infection.   High-risk HPV types like HPV 16 and HPV 18 are strongly linked to a higher risk of cervical cancer, including high-grade cervical dysplasia and invasive cancer.

        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) E6 stimulates the expression of TERT. Explanation: E6 and E7 proteins from high-risk HPV types exhibit increased affinity for key cellular regulatory proteins (e.g., p53, RB) compared to low-risk HPV types. This enhanced affinity allows high-risk HPV-infected cells to evade tumour suppressor mechanisms, dysregulate cell cycle control, and promote oncogenic transformation. Oncogenic Activities of E6 Protein Oncogenic Activities of E7 Protein Binds to and promotes degradation of p53 → Impairs cell growth and apoptosis regulation (Option A).

        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) EBV Explanation:   The ‘starry sky pattern’ of histopathology represents scattered macrophages with phagocytosed cell debris among proliferating lymphoma cells is characteristic of Burkitt lymphoma. Burkitt Lymphoma:   Burkitt lymphoma is an aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.   It is most commonly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, which is endemic in central Africa and New Guinea, where it is the most common childhood tumour.   EBV, a DNA oncogenic virus, infects epithelial cells of the oropharynx and B-cells via the CD21 molecule on their surface. Its LMP-1 (latent membrane protein-1) gene activates NF- κβ and JAK/STAT pathways, promoting B-cell survival and proliferation, increasing the risk of B-cell lymphoma.   Another EBV gene, EBNA-2, transactivates host genes like cyclin D and src family genes.   EBV's genome contains viral IL-10, suppressing T-cell activation by macrophages and monocytes, crucial for EBV-induced B-cell transformation.   EBV acts as a polyclonal B-cell mitogen, leading to t(8;14) translocation and Burkitt’s lymphoma.   EBV-related cancers include: Hodgkin’s lymphoma (predominantly mixed cellularity type) Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) Post-transplant lymphoma Burkitt’s lymphoma Nasopharyngeal carcinoma Gastric carcinoma Leiomyosarcoma   Hodgkin’s lymphoma (predominantly mixed cellularity type)   Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)   Post-transplant lymphoma   Burkitt’s lymphoma   Nasopharyngeal carcinoma   Gastric carcinoma   Leiomyosarcoma   Hodgkin’s lymphoma (predominantly mixed cellularity type)   Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)   Post-transplant lymphoma   Burkitt’s lymphoma   Nasopharyngeal carcinoma   Gastric carcinoma   Leiomyosarcoma HTLV-1 ( Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type 1 ) (Option B)   HTLV-1, a human retrovirus, causes adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL)   HTLV-1 contains genes such as tax and HBZ, potentially contributing to cancer   HTLV-1 may also cause Tropical spastic paraparesis, a demyelinating disorder.   Atypical lymphocytes with clover leaf nuclei are seen in peripheral blood smear. HHV-8 (Human Herpes virus) (Option C):   HHV-8, also known as Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), is closely associated with Kaposi sarcoma, primarily in immunocompromised individuals.   In AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, HHV-8 pathogenesis is exacerbated by HIV, facilitating its dissemination and increasing the risk of tumours.   HHV-8 is also linked to primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman disease (Both are B-cell disorders). Aspergillus flavus (Option D):   Aspergillus flavus is a fungus known to produce aflatoxins, which are carcinogenic compounds associated with hepatocellular carcinoma.   Aflatoxin B1, produced by Aspergillus moulds on stored grains and nuts, causes a specific mutation (G:C →T: A transversion) at codon 249 in P53, leading to hepatocellular carcinoma."

        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Gastric lymphomas associated with H. pylori infection are primarily of B-cell origin. Explanation:   H. pylori, the first bacterium classified as a carcinogen, is associated with gastric adenocarcinomas and lymphomas, including MALT lymphomas of B-cell origin.   Gastric adenocarcinomas arise due to increased epithelial cell proliferation in chronic inflammation caused by H. pylori infection.   Pathogenicity genes like CagA (cytotoxin-associated A) trigger uncontrolled growth factor pathways. (Option B)   H. pylori produces a bacterial toxin VacA, inducing apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells and influencing cancer development. (Option C)   Chronic H. pylori infection leads to polyclonal B-cell proliferation triggered by H. pylori-reactive T cells, which contribute to the development of MALT lymphomas.   Antibiotic therapy can eradicate H. pylori and \"cure\" MALT lymphomas by removing the antigenic stimulus for T cells .

        "solution": "CORRECT ANSWER: 3) Xeroderma pigmentosum, nucleotide excision repair EXPLANATION: The clinical presentation is suggestive of xeroderma pigmentosum, caused due to defective DNA nucleotide excision repair (Option 1). Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP):   It is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sun sensitivity, with approximately 50% of patients having acute burning on minimal sun exposure.   UV radiation causes the cross-linking of pyrimidine residues , preventing normal DNA replication. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) prevents this DNA damage.   Inherited loss-of-function mutations in any of these genes give rise to xeroderma pigmentosum.   The onset of freckling (lentigines) on sun-exposed skin before age two years in most patients.   At an early age, there is a significantly increased risk of sunlight-induced cutaneous neoplasms (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma) . Cockyane syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by a defect in nucleotide excision repair . But unlike XP, there is no increased incidence of neoplasia ( Option 2). Bloom syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in a helicase required for homologous recombination repair (Option 4)."

        "answer": 4,
        "solution": "CORRECT ANSWER: D) Amsterdam II criteria are used for diagnosis. EXPLANATION: Amsterdam II criteria are used for the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome (Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer). (Option B)   Three or more relatives with Lynch syndrome-associated cancers (colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, stomach, small bowel, ureter, or renal pelvis cancer).   At least one affected relative is a first-degree relative of the others.   Two successive generations are affected.   One or more relatives are diagnosed with Lynch syndrome-associated cancer before age 50.   FAP excluded. Lynch syndrome (Hereditary polyposis non-colorectal cancer):   It is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with carcinomas that arise predominantly in the cecum and proximal colon. (Option A)   Individuals with HNPCC syndrome inherit one abnormal copy of a mismatch repair gene. (Option C)   Trouble arises when cells acquire somatic loss of- function mutations, presumably at random, in their single normal alleles.   Germline loss-of-function mutations in at least four different genes can produce HNPCC syndrome.   The most commonly affected genes are MSH2 and MLH1 , each accounting for approximately 30% of HNPCC syndrome.   Microsatellite instability is also observed in about 15% of sporadic colon cancers and less frequently in many other cancer types.   In sporadic cancers, defects in mismatch repair usually stem from epigenetic silencing of the MLH1 gene rather than somatic mutations. Lynch syndrome is the only autosomal dominant defective DNA repair disease (all other defective DNA repair diseases are autosomal recessive in inheritance)."

        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "CORRECT ANSWER: C) Cancer cells exhibit increased glucose uptake and preferentially metabolise glucose via glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen. EXPLANATION: A unique metabolic characteristic seen in cancer cells is the Warburg effect. Warburg effect:   Even in the presence of ample oxygen, cancer cells demonstrate a distinctive form of cellular metabolism characterised by high glucose uptake levels and increased glucose conversion to lactose (fermentation) via glycolysis (Option D)   Otto Warburg was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1931 for this theory.   Even though ATP production is low with lactate formation compared to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, it provides metabolic intermediates needed for synthesising cellular components.   Warburg effect is the basis of positive emission tomography (PET). Patients are injected with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) , a non-metabolizable glucose derivative preferentially taken up into tumour cells (due to glucose hunger), which can be detected by PET scan.   Patients are injected with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) , a non-metabolizable glucose derivative preferentially taken up into tumour cells (due to glucose hunger), which can be detected by PET scan.   Patients are injected with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) , a non-metabolizable glucose derivative preferentially taken up into tumour cells (due to glucose hunger), which can be detected by PET scan. Cancer cells primarily rely on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production (Option A), which is not true, as cancer cells prefer glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen. It involves a shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cells (Option B), which is incorrect because the Warburg effect involves the opposite: a shift toward glycolysis. It is characterized by decreased glucose uptake and utilization by cancer cells (Option D) is inaccurate, as cancer cells actually increase glucose uptake and metabolism via glycolysis."

        "solution": "CORRECT ANSWER: D) Enhanced antigen presentation to promote T cell activation EXPLANATION: Enhanced antigen presentation is not a mechanism tumour cells employ to evade the host immune system.   Antigen presentation is a crucial step in activating T cells and initiating an immune response against tumour cells.   Antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, present tumor antigens to T cells via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, leading to T cell activation and anti-tumour immune responses.   While tumour cells may downregulate or alter the expression of MHC molecules to evade immune recognition, enhancing antigen presentation to promote T-cell activation is not a typical strategy employed by tumour cells for immune evasion. Mechanisms by which tumour cells evade the host immune system:   Selective outgrowth of the antigen-negative variants (Option A).   Reduced expression of MHC molecules (Option B).

        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Option B - Enhancer deletion:   Enhancer deletion is not a mechanism that directly converts a proto-oncogene to an oncogene.   Enhancers are regulatory DNA sequences that enhance the transcription of genes.   While enhancer mutations can contribute to gene dysregulation, they do not directly convert a proto-oncogene to an oncogene. Incorrect Options: Option A - Promoter insertion:   Promoter insertion is a genetic alteration that can convert a proto-oncogene to an oncogene.   When a promoter sequence is inserted near a proto-oncogene, it can lead to increased and unregulated expression of the gene, promoting cell growth and division. Option C - Gene amplification:   Gene amplification refers to an increase in the number of copies of a specific gene.   If a proto-oncogene undergoes amplification, it results in an increased dosage of the gene product, leading to abnormal cell proliferation and potentially converting it to an oncogene. Option D - Point mutation:   Point mutations, which are single nucleotide changes in the DNA sequence, can convert a proto-oncogene to an oncogene.   Point mutations can result in altered protein function, increased protein stability, or constitutive activation of signalling pathways, promoting uncontrolled cell growth and division."

          "D": "In prevents apoptosis and makes the cancer immortal"
        },
        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Option B - It forms metabolic intermediates which are needed for cell growth and multiplication:   Neoplastic cells utilise a metabolic pathway known as the Warburg effect, which involves the conversion of glucose to lactate even in the presence of sufficient oxygen, resulting in lower ATP production than in normal cells.   This phenomenon is also known as aerobic glycolysis.   Neoplastic cells use this pathway as it generates metabolic intermediates such as pyruvate and lactate, which are required for the biosynthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids, which are essential for cell growth and division. Incorrect Options: Option A - It decreases glucose utilisation by neoplastic cells:   Warburg metabolism increases glucose utilisation by neoplastic cells. Option C - It provides more energy in the form of increased ATP production:   Warburg metabolism produces less ATP than oxidative phosphorylation. Option D - In prevents apoptosis and makes the cancer immortal:   Warburg metabolism is not the direct cause of preventing apoptosis.   While altered metabolism in cancer cells can contribute to their survival and resistance to apoptosis, there are other factors involved in these processes, including genetic mutations, dysregulation of signalling pathways, and interactions with the tumor microenvironment."

They are not specific markers for lymphoid cells and are not typically used in the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Incorrect Options: Option A - TdT:   Tdt is an enzyme that is typically present in the early stages of lymphoid cell development.   It is not found in mature lymphocytes but is expressed in lymphoblasts, which are the immature precursor cells in ALL.   Tdt is commonly used as a marker to identify and confirm the presence of lymphoblasts in ALL.

        },
        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Option B - E7:   The human papillomavirus (HPV) inactivates the retinoblastoma (RB) gene primarily through the action of the E7 protein.   The E7 protein of high-risk HPV types, such as HPV-16 and HPV-18, is crucial in promoting cell cycle progression and inhibiting cell cycle checkpoints.   E7 interacts with the p105Rb (retinoblastoma protein), encoded by the Rb gene, leading to its inactivation.   By binding to p105RB, E7 disrupts the normal interaction between p105RB and E2F, a transcription factor involved in cell cycle control.   This disruption results in the release of E2F, allowing it to activate genes required for cell cycle progression, including genes involved in DNA replication.   Consequently, the cell cycle becomes dysregulated, and uncontrolled cell proliferation can occur, a hallmark of HPV-associated cancers. Incorrect Options: Option A - E6: The E6 protein of HPV primarily targets and degrades the tumor suppressor protein p53, rather than inactivating the RB gene. Option C - L1: The L1 protein is the major capsid protein of HPV and plays a role in the virus particle assembly. Option D - L2: The L2 protein is a capsid protein of HPV, which assists in entering the viral DNA into the host cell during infection."

The starry sky appearance in the biopsy is due to the presence of macrophages that have engulfed apoptotic tumor cells, creating a pattern reminiscent of stars in the night sky.   Burkitt lymphoma is characterized by the translocation of the MYC gene.   The MYC gene is located on chromosome 8 and encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation.   In Burkitt lymphoma, there is a characteristic translocation involving the MYC gene, most commonly the t(8;14)(q24;q32) translocation.   This translocation juxtaposes the MYC gene with the enhancer region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH), resulting in dysregulated MYC expression.

        "answer": 4,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: D) Has a lag phase between exposure and response. Explanation: The lag phase between exposure and response is not a feature of innate immunity as it acts rapidly against pathogens.   The lag phase is a feature of adaptive immunity. It specifically targets the pathogen causing infection, so it first needs to recognize the pathogen. This means that it’s slower to respond than the innate immune system, but it’s more accurate when it does respond.   Because of immunological memory, the next time it faces the same pathogen, there is a quick and robust response.   Innate immunity is the body's first line of defense against pathogens, present since birth. It responds similarly to all germs and foreign substances, hence the term non-specific immune system. Difference between innate and acquired immunity Innate/native immunity Acquired/adaptive immunity Present since birth (Option A) Occurs after exposure to the pathogen Quick, non-specific response (Option C) Slower, specific response to a pathogen No immunological memory Has immunological memory Examples include : Epithelial barriers like skin, GIT.

        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) NK cells Explanation: In this scenario, the patient has a viral infection, and the body's initial defense mechanism against the virus is Natural Killer (NK) cells. Natural Killer cell (NK) :   Produced by a large granular lymphocyte.   Constitutes 5 to 10% of circulating blood lymphocytes.   Function: It can be part of both innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity: Directly kill the virus-infected cells or tumour cells. Adaptive immunity: Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.   It can be part of both innate and adaptive immunity.   Innate immunity:   Directly kill the virus-infected cells or tumour cells.   Adaptive immunity:   Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.   Popular markers for NK cells: CD 16 and CD 56.   CD 56: The role is still not fully understood.   CD 16: Detect and bind to Fc fragment of IgG on target cells and kill the cell by perforins and by releasing toxins and granzymes.   Nk cells have 2 different kinds of receptors. Activating receptors: NKG2D. Inhibitory receptors: CD94, CD 96 (these prevent self-cells from being attacked by NK cells).

        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Class II Explanation: In a patient with typhoid infection (caused by Salmonella typhi), antigen presentation primarily involves MHC class II molecules, which present antigens derived from extracellular pathogens to activate an immune response. Class I MHC class I molecules present endogenous antigens derived from intracellular pathogens, such as viruses and some bacteria. Class II MHC class II molecules present exogenous antigens derived from extracellular pathogens, such as Salmonella typhi, the bacterium responsible for typhoid fever. Class III MHC class III molecules are not involved in antigen presentation. They encode components of the complement system and other immune-related molecules. Non-MHC-dependent antigen presentationWhile non-MHC-dependent antigen presentation can occur through mechanisms like CD1 molecules presenting lipid antigens.   Class II MHC molecules are expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells.   These cells process exogenous antigens derived from extracellular microbes and proteins after internalization into endosomes or lysosomes.   The internalized proteins are broken down into peptides and associated with class II MHC in the vesicles and transported to the cell surface as stable peptide-MHC complexes.   The class II-peptide complex is recognized by CD4+/helper T cells. Class II MHC molecules present antigens derived from extracellular pathogens to CD4+ helper T cells, initiating an immune response."

MHC-1 molecules are expressed on all nucleated cells, antigen-presenting cells, and platelets   Mature RBCs that lack a nucleus don't express MHC-1   They are heterodimers with a polymorphic α or heavy chain linked non-covalently to a smaller β2-microglobulin.   The antigen is bound within a groove between the α1 and α2 domains of the alpha chain.   This, along with the β2-microglobulin, forms a stable complex to be displayed on the cell surface. In MHC class II molecules, similar to MHC class I, the antigen-binding site is also formed by the alpha 1 and beta 1 domains, binding peptides derived from extracellular proteins presented by antigen-presenting cells.   They consist of 2 alpha and 2 beta chains of equal length.   The invariant chain is a protein structure associated with MHC-2. It is associated with MHC-2 within endosomes to prevent the binding of endogenous antigens. The invariant chain is later broken down, while MHC-2 is moved to the cell surface."

        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) IgG Explanation: The given clinical scenario describes Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), also known as erythroblastosis fetalis, occurs when there is an incompatibility between the blood types of a mother and her fetus.   This condition is often caused by Rh (Rhesus) blood group incompatibility, where the mother is Rh-negative and the fetus is Rh-positive. During pregnancy, maternal antibodies of the IgG class against the Rh antigen can cross the placenta and attack the fetal red blood cells (RBCs), leading to hemolysis (destruction of RBCs) in the fetus.   This results in various degrees of anaemia and potentially severe complications for the newborn.   This crossing is facilitated by active transplacental transfer mechanisms, primarily mediated by syncytiotrophoblast cells expressing neonatal Fc receptors (FcRn). These receptors interact with the Fc domain of IgG, permitting their transfer.   This phenomenon is also responsible for newborns' passive immunity, with IgG being the most abundant antibody in their circulation. IgM (Option A) are multinucleated giant cells found in granulomas. They consist of huge cytoplasm and multiple nuclei that are derived from the fusion of multiple activated macrophages. It cannot cross the placenta due to its large size (pentameric structure). IgD and IgE (Option C and D) are also incapable of crossing the placenta."

        "solution": "Correct answer: C) Formation of immune complexes → Deposition in tissues → Inflammation and tissue injury. Explanation: Phases of Type 3 hypersensitivity: 1. Formation of Immune Complexes :   After introducing a protein antigen, antibodies are formed (typically within one week) and react with the antigen in circulation, creating antigen-antibody complexes. 2. Deposition of Immune Complexes :   These complexes circulate and are deposited in blood vessels, particularly in organs like the kidneys and joints.   Medium-sized complexes formed in slight antigen excess are most pathogenic. 3. Inflammation and Tissue Injury:   Deposited immune complexes trigger acute inflammation about 10 days post-antigen exposure, leading to symptoms like fever, joint pain, and proteinuria.   Complement activation contributes to tissue injury, with serum C3 levels potentially serving as a marker for disease activity.

        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Peripheral tolerance Explanation: The clinical scenario likely describes IPEX (immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked) due to defective peripheral tolerance.   IPEX is an X-linked immune dysregulation disorder that presents in childhood. It occurs due to defects in the FOXP3 gene, which plays a crucial role in peripheral tolerance mediated by CD4+ T regulatory cells.   Defects in FOXP3 lead to dysfunctional CD4+ T regulatory cells, impairing their ability to maintain immune tolerance and resulting in autoimmune reactions against various tissues, particularly within the gastrointestinal tract. It has a classic triad of: Defective central tolerance (Option A) may cause autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (APS) due to a mutation in the AIRE gene, which is characterized by chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, abnormalities of skin, dental enamel, and nails (ectodermal dystrophy), autoimmune adrenalitis, autoimmune hypoparathyroidism, idiopathic hypogonadism, pernicious anaemia. Anergy (Option C) is a tolerance mechanism in which lymphocytes are intrinsically functionally inactivated following an antigen encounter. Induction of anergy can be helpful in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and allergies. It has no role in IPEX.

Joints: Non-erosive arthritis commonly affects the hands, wrists, and knees.   Renal: Lupus nephritis ranging from asymptomatic proteinuria to severe kidney failure. The major cause of morbidity and mortality in SLE.   Cardiovascular: Pericarditis, myocarditis, increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.   Pulmonary: Pleurisy and pleural effusion, pulmonary hypertension and interstitial lung.   Neurologic: Neuropsychiatric symptoms ranging from headaches and cognitive dysfunction to seizures and psychosis.   Hematologic: Anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The risk of thrombotic events is increased. Dermatomyositis (Option A) can present with skin rash, muscle weakness, and occasionally joint pain, but it typically lacks the malar rash seen in SLE. Psoriatic arthritis (Option C) can present with joint pain, swelling, and skin involvement, but it does not typically present with a malar rash or photosensitivity, as seen in SLE. Ankylosing Spondylitis (Option D) primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, leading to inflammatory back pain and stiffness.

        "solution": "Correct answer: D) Testis Explanation: Among the given options, the testis is an immune-privileged site. The testis, eye, and brain are called immune-privileged sites because antigens are sequestered from the immune system without communicating with blood and lymph. Brain Blood-brain barrier Eyes Blood-ocular barrier Testes Blood-testicular barrier   These tissues fail to elicit immune responses and are ignored by the immune system.   If the antigens of these tissues are released as a consequence of trauma or infection, an immune response will result, leading to prolonged inflammation and injury.   This is the postulated mechanism for post-traumatic orchitis and uveitis."

IIMesangial proliferative nephritisMesangial cell proliferation is often accompanied by mesangial matrix accumulation, granular mesangial immunoglobulin deposits, and complement without the involvement of glomerular capillaries. IIIFocal nephritis Involvement of <50% of glomeruli. The lesions may be segmental (affecting only a portion of the glomerulus) or global (involving the entire glomerulus). Affected glomeruli may exhibit swelling and proliferation of endothelial and mesangial cells, leukocyte accumulation, capillary necrosis, and hyaline thrombi. There is also often extra capillary proliferation associated with focal necrosis and crescent formation. IV Diffuse nephritisM/C lesion in lupus nephritis. Shows the endothelial, mesangial, and epithelial cell proliferation in Bowman's space. Subendothelial immune complex deposits cause circumferential thickening of the capillary wall, forming wire loop lesions V Membranous nephritisDiffuse thickening of the capillary walls due to deposition of subepithelial immune complexes.

        },
        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Primary Raynaud phenomenon Explanation: The given clinical scenario describes the Raynaud phenomenon (an exaggerated vasoconstriction of arteries and arterioles in response to cold or emotional stress.   The fingers classically show red, white, and blue colour changes from most proximal to most distal, correlating with proximal vasodilation, central vasoconstriction, and more distal cyanosis.   Untreated RP may result in ulceration and, in severe cases, autoamputation.   Primary Raynaud's phenomenon is characterized by symmetric episodes of finger whitening induced by cold, resulting from hyper reactive smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel walls. It occurs without an underlying disorder and typically does not lead to ulcers. Tests for autoimmune conditions yield negative results in such cases.   Secondary Raynaud's phenomenon results from underlying arterial disease seen in autoimmune disorders like mixed connective tissue disease, CREST syndrome, and SLE. It shows asymmetric finger involvement and progressive worsening of symptoms over time. (Option C) Dermatomyositis (Option B) may involve the hands, with classical lesions being Gottron papules (multiple hyperkeratotic, flat, red papules over the dorsum of the metacarpophalangeal joints) and mechanic hands (fissuring with hyperkeratotic papules, scaling, and fissures along the sides of the fingers and palms).

Scleroderma, also known as systemic sclerosis, is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by excessive collagen production, which leads to thickening and hardening of the skin and other organs.   It is predominantly seen in females and has a peak incidence in the 50-60 age group.   Localized scleroderma primarily affects the skin, typically confined to areas such as the fingers, forearms, and face, while systemic sclerosis involves both skin and internal organs. Subtypes In systemic sclerosis:   Limited systemic sclerosis (CREST syndrome) features calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, oesophagal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia. It is characterized by a positive anti-centromere antibody (option C)   Diffuse systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) features widespread skin thickening starting from fingers, positive Anti-SCL-70 antibody, and extensive organ involvement: GIT dysfunction, musculoskeletal inflammation, scleroderma renal crisis, interstitial lung fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac manifestations.

Polymyositis:   Polymyositis is an adult-onset inflammatory myopathy.   Pathogenesis: Unknown, but it is believed to have an immunologic basis.   CD8+ cytotoxic T cells are the mediators of tissue damage.   Endomysial inflammation is seen and no atrophy. Dermatomyositis (Option A) also presents with proximal muscle weakness and elevated CK levels, but it typically includes skin manifestations (e.g., heliotrope rash, Gottron's papules), which are not mentioned here. Muscle biopsy in dermatomyositis typically shows perifascicular atrophy with CD4+ T cells, rather than the endomysial inflammation and CD8+ T cells seen in polymyositis. Myasthenia Gravis (Option B) commonly presents with fluctuating muscle weakness that worsens with activity and typically involves ocular muscles (ptosis, diplopia) early on, which are not described here. Diagnosis is based on clinical history, physical findings, identification of anti-ACh receptor autoantibodies, and electrophysiologic studies. Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) (Option C) can affect the quadriceps and the distal upper extremity muscles commonly with elevated CK levels, especially in older adults.

        "solution": "CORRECT ANSWER: A) WASP gene mutation EXPLANATION: WASP gene mutation analysis, specific to Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked recessive disease characterized by the triad of:   Thrombocytopenia   Eczema   Recurrent infections Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene located at Xp11.23, which encodes the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP).   WASP belongs to a family of proteins that are believed to link membrane receptors, such as antigen receptors, to cytoskeletal elements.   Patients do not make antibodies to polysaccharide antigens, and the response to protein antigens is poor.   IgM levels in the serum are low, but levels of IgG are usually normal.   Paradoxically, the levels of IgA and IgE are often elevated. Patients are also prone to developing B-cell lymphomas.   WASP may be involved in cytoskeleton-dependent responses, including cell migration and signal transduction, but the essential functions of this protein in lymphocytes and platelets are unclear.   It may lead to early death. The only treatment is HSC transplantation.

        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Washed red blood cells Explanation: Patients with selective IgA deficiency risk developing anaphylactic reactions if they receive IgA blood products. To minimize this risk, it is essential to transfuse blood products that have been processed to reduce IgA levels, such as washed red blood cells. In contrast, standard red blood cells or IgA-rich products could trigger severe allergic reactions, as seen in this patient. Selective IgA deficiency:   It is caused by impaired differentiation of naïve B lymphocytes to IgA-producing plasma cells.   Most individuals are asymptomatic.   IgA is the primary antibody found in mucosal secretions, and its deficiency weakens mucosal defences.   This can lead to infections in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts.   Symptomatic patients often experience recurrent sinus and lung infections, as well as diarrhoea.   Patients with IgA deficiency frequently suffer from respiratory allergies and a range of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis.   When transfused with blood containing normal IgA, some individuals may experience severe and potentially fatal anaphylactic reactions, as their immune system treats the IgA as a foreign antigen.   In this situation, the safest method is to use washed red blood cells, plasma, or platelets from known IgA-deficient donors."

        "answer": 4,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: D) Pneumocystis jirovecii Explanation: The clinical presentation of recurrent infections along with the findings of mutation in CD40L gene suggests the diagnosis of Hyper IgM syndrome. Hyper IgM syndrome:   Normally, the antigen binds to the antibody on B cells and is then presented to the T cells.   CD40L (also known as CD154) on antigen-activated CD4+ helper T cells binds to CD40 on B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs).   This interaction is crucial for triggering Ig class switching (from IgM to IgG, IgA, and IgE) and affinity maturation in B cells.   In hyper IgM syndrome, there is a defect in the CD40 receptor or CD40 ligand (most common).   As a result, patients have high IgM levels but low levels of IgG, IgA, and IgE, and are prone to recurrent infections.

        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Hyper IgM syndrome Explanation: The clinical presentation of autoimmune hemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia with the flow cytometry findings showing CD40 negative and CD19 negative, is most likely suggestive of Hyper IgM syndrome. Hyper IgM syndrome:   In hyper IgM syndrome, mature B cells are present, but they are incapable of Ig class switching and affinity maturation because of a defect in the CD40 receptor or CD40 ligand.   The patient’s serum will have elevated levels of IgM but no IgA or IgE and extremely low levels of IgG.   Occasionally, the IgM antibodies react with blood cells, giving rise to autoimmune hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Flow cytometry:   Flow cytometry results are typically represented as histograms or dot plots: Histograms: Represent the frequency distribution of a single parameter. Dot plots: Display two parameters on the x- and y-axes.   Histograms: Represent the frequency distribution of a single parameter.   Dot plots: Display two parameters on the x- and y-axes.

The majority of the cells are in the double negative quadrant, indicating that both CD40 and CD19 are almost negative in this patient, suggesting the diagnosis of hyper IgM syndrome.   Hyper IgM syndrome (Option C) is characterized by CD40L deficiency (X-linked) or CD40 deficiency (autosomal recessive), which affects both B and T cells. Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria(Option A): A flow cytogram of blood from a patient with PNH shows a population of red cells that is deficient in both CD55 and CD59. Glanzmann Thrombasthenia (Option D): It is a platelet disorder characterized by glycoprotein IIb/IIIa defect, also known as CD41 (GpIIb) and CD61 (GpIIIa).

B-cell Deficiency: In XLA, B-cell precursors fail to mature due to defective BTK, leading to a severe shortage or absence of mature B cells in the bloodstream.   Immunoglobulin Levels: Markedly reduced levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM are observed in XLA, resulting in susceptibility to recurrent bacterial infections.   Lymphoid Tissue Impact: Germinal centres in lymph nodes and tonsils fail to develop properly, leading to absent or underdeveloped tonsils and lymph nodes.   Clinical Presentation: Patients typically present with frequent respiratory tract infections caused by bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus.   Management: Treatment involves immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IVIG) to restore antibody levels and reduce infections. The classic form of this disease has the following characteristics:   B cells are absent or markedly decreased in the circulation, and serum levels of all classes of immunoglobulins are depressed. Pre–B cells, which express the B-lineage marker CD19 but not membrane Ig, are found in normal numbers in the bone marrow.   Germinal centres of lymph nodes, Peyer patches, the appendix, and tonsils are underdeveloped.   Plasma cells are absent throughout the body.   T cell-mediated reactions are normal. Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) (Option A):   CVID involves defective antibody production and recurrent bacterial infections, mainly in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.   Typically presents later in life, during adolescence or adulthood, unlike XLA. Options B, D: Absent tonsils and lymph nodes are not specific to SCID and Hyper-IgM Syndrome."

        },
        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Ataxia Telangiectasia Explanation: The clinical scenario (dysarthria, slurred speech, recurrent infections, telangiectasia shown in the image above, decreased serum IgA, IgG, and IgE) suggests ataxia telangiectasia.   Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal-recessive disorder.   Key features: abnormal gait (ataxia), vascular malformations (telangiectases), neurological deficits, increased tumors, and immunodeficiency.   Immunodeficiency impacts both B and T cells, mainly causing defective production of IgA and IgG2 antibodies.   Thymic hypoplasia often results in milder T-cell defects.   Patients frequently experience respiratory tract infections, autoimmune issues, and higher cancer risks.   Caused by a mutation in the gene on chromosome 11 encoding the ATM protein kinase.   ATM activates p53 in response to DNA damage, prompting cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis. ATM deficiency impairs DNA repair, affecting antigen receptor generation and Ig isotype switching.   Significantly increased risk of lymphoma in AT patients. Hereditary spastic paraplegia (Option A) presents with spasticity in the lower limbs but does not typically involve cerebellar dysfunction or telangiectasias. Friedreich ataxia (Option B) is a trinucleotide repeat disorder that presents with progressive gait and limb ataxia but does not typically present with telangiectasias or immunodeficiency. Spinocerebellar ataxia (Option D) type 1 is characterised by progressive cerebellar ataxia but does not typically present with telangiectasias or immunodeficiency."

        "solution": "Correct Answer: D) Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) Explanation: Adenosine deaminase deficiency aligns with the clinical picture of SCID, where affected individuals are highly susceptible to severe infections. Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID): Various genetically distinct syndromes with defects in both humoral and cell-mediated immunity.   Presentation: Infants show oral candidiasis (thrush), extensive diaper rash, and failure to thrive.   GVHD: Some may develop a rash from maternal T cells attacking the fetus.   T-Cell Defect: Typically primary, with secondary impairment of humoral immunity.   Treatment: Requires hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or gene therapy. Types of SCID:   X-Linked SCID: The most frequent form primarily affects boys. Mutation in the common γ -chain (γc) subunit of cytokine receptors. Severe reduction in T-cell numbers, impaired antibody synthesis, and often deficiency in NK cells due to IL-15 receptor involvement. Contains lobules resembling fetal thymus.

        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) DiGeorge syndrome Explanation:   DiGeorge syndrome, or 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, is characterised by a microdeletion on chromosome 22q11.   Clinical features represented by CATCH22   C: Cardiac defects, especially conotruncal anomalies   A: Abnormal facial features, such as low set ears, hypertelorism, and short philtrum   T: Thymic hypoplasia   C: Cleft palate or cellular immune deficiency   H: Hypoparathyroidism with hypocalcemia   It presents with low immunity and recurrent infections due to variable loss of T cell-mediated immunity (resulting from hypoplasia or lack of the thymus), tetany (resulting from lack of the parathyroids), congenital defects of the heart (Tetralogy of Fallot) and greatvessels. Facial dysmorphisms, including a long face with a prominent nasal bridge, areconsistent with the findings in this case.   The T-cell zones of lymphoid organs—the paracortical areas of the lymph nodes and the periarteriolar sheaths of the spleen—are depleted.   Ig levels may be normal or reduced, depending on the severity of the T-cell deficiency. One gene in the deleted region is TBX1, which is required to develop the branchial arch and the great vessels. Down syndrome (Option A): Down syndrome is characterized by trisomy 21. Turner syndrome (Option B): Turner syndrome results from complete or partial monosomy of the X chromosome. Cri-du-chat syndrome (Option D): Cri-du-chat syndrome is caused by a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5. It presents with a high-pitched cat-like cry, intellectual disability, microcephaly, and facial dysmorphisms but lacks the cardiac anomalies and thymic aplasia seen in DiGeorge syndrome."

        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "CORRECT ANSWER: C) Congo red stain EXPLANATION: The clinical presentation of a patient with poorly controlled diabetes and hypertension, hepatomegaly, bilateral lower extremity oedema, proteinuria, and elevated serum creatinine highly point towards a diagnosis of AA amyloidosis, where chronic inflammation leads to the production of SAA, resulting in amyloid deposition in various organs. Congo red stain is the most appropriate technique to confirm the diagnosis of amyloidosis. Investigations in amyloidosis:   The diagnosis depends on the histologic demonstration of amyloid deposits in tissues.   The most common sites biopsied are the kidney when renal manifestations are present or rectal or gingival tissues in patients suspected of having systemic amyloidosis.   Examination of abdominal fat aspirates stained with Congo red can also be used for the diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis. Stains/technique Appearance Congo red Most widely used and specific. Light microscopy: Salmon pink/red stains. Polarising microscopy: Apple-green birefringence. H & E Eosin & hematoxylin staining on light microscopy. Amorphous, eosinophilic, extracellular substance. Thioflavin T Fluorescent stain. Yellow colour under UV light. Electron microscopy Non-branching fibrils of indefinite length. Diameter: 7.5-10 nm. X-ray crystallography & infrared spectroscopy Cross-β-pleated sheet conformation. Methyl violet Crystal violet PASAmyloid positive.   Gross staining by Lugol's Iodine - Mahogany brown appearance   Abdominal fat aspiration is preferred over rectal biopsy.   In suspected cases of AL amyloidosis, serum, and urine protein electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis should be performed.   Bone marrow aspirates in such cases often show monoclonal plasmacytosis, even in the absence of overt multiple myeloma.   Scintigraphy with radiolabeled serum amyloid P component is a rapid and specific test since it binds to the amyloid deposits and reveals their presence.   It also gives a measure of the extent of amyloidosis and can be used to follow patients undergoing treatment. The given images below show Congo red staining in amyloidosis. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain(Option A): While positive for amyloid, it's not specific and less commonly used for diagnosis. Masson trichrome stain(Option B): Primarily used for connective tissue (collagen appears blue, smooth muscles appear red, the nucleus appears black), not specific for amyloid.

        "solution": "Correct answer: B) Preformed antibodies in the recipient Explanation: The given clinical scenario suggests hyperacute graft rejection due to preformed antibodies in the recipient. Antibodies specific for antigens on graft endothelial cells immediately react with the graft, leading to endothelial injury, rapid thrombosis and ischemia of the transplanted organ.   Hyperacute rejection occurs within minutes to hours after or even during transplantation and is characterised by the following:   Mechanism: It is mediated by preformed antibodies in the recipient's blood that react against donor antigens on the graft's vascular endothelium. (Type 2 hypersensitivity reaction)   Antibodies involved: These are usually anti-HLA antibodies or ABO blood group antibodies that the recipient has developed due to previous exposures such as pregnancies, blood transfusions, or previous transplants.   Pathophysiology: When these antibodies bind to the graft's endothelium, they activate the complement system, leading to rapid thrombosis and occlusion of the graft vessels.   Histology: The arterioles of the affected kidney develop acute fibrinoid necrosis, with thrombi narrowing or occluding their lumens.   Option C:(cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated injury) and D (CD4+ cell-mediated inflammation) are involved in acute cellular rejection, which occurs days to weeks after transplantation, not within minutes, as described in this scenario.

The presentation occurs two months post-transplant, which is a typical timeframe for acute humoral rejection. It usually occurs within the first year after transplantation but can happen at any time. Acute humoral rejection Acute cellular rejection Acute humoral rejection mediated by newly synthesized antibodies. It causes endothelial damage and complement activation. Type II or III hypersensitivity. No response to increasing doses of immunosuppressive drugs. Treatment: B cell depleting agents. Microscopic appearance: Fibrinoid necrosis in vessels. Deposition of C4d in peritubular capillaries. (Complement breakdown product). C4d is the marker for acute humoral rejection.Mediated by CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. Type IV hypersensitivity reaction. Responsive to increasing doses of immunosuppressive drugs. Microscopic appearance: Tubulointerstitial pattern: Tubulitis : Destruction of tubules + inflammatory cells in tubules. mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate. vascular pattern: Endothelitis   CD8+ T cells directly destroy graft cells, or CD4+ cells secrete cytokines and induce inflammation, which damages the graft. Two types of cellular graft rejection: In the tubulointerstitial pattern, there is extensive interstitial inflammation and tubulitis. In the vascular pattern, there is inflammation of vessels and necrosis of vessel walls.   In the tubulointerstitial pattern, there is extensive interstitial inflammation and tubulitis.   In the vascular pattern, there is inflammation of vessels and necrosis of vessel walls.   Clinical presentation: Sudden oliguria indicates a rapid decline in graft function Fever and graft site swelling are consistent with an inflammatory process These symptoms suggest an acute rejection episode rather than a more gradual process   Sudden oliguria indicates a rapid decline in graft function   Fever and graft site swelling are consistent with an inflammatory process   These symptoms suggest an acute rejection episode rather than a more gradual process   Biopsy findings: The biopsy shows inflamed kidney filters and small blood vessels with complement proteins.

Biopsy in this condition shows tubular injury and arteriolar hyalinosis, rather than the glomerular inflammation or complement deposition seen in this case. Acute cellular rejection (Option C): While acute cellular rejection can cause fever and graft dysfunction, its biopsy findings differ from this case. It shows tubulitis and T-cell infiltration, not complement deposition. This type of rejection is T-cell mediated, unlike the antibody-mediated process suggested by the biopsy findings here. BK virus infection (Option D): This usually presents more gradually, 2- 6 months post-transplant, due to immunosuppression, and rarely causes fever or graft swelling.

          "A": "Acute transplant rejection",
          "B": "Chronic transplant rejection",
          "C": "Graft-versus-host disease",
          "D": "Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome"
        },
        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Graft-versus-host disease Explanation: The given clinical presentation and history of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant suggests that the patient most likely has graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)   GVHD occurs when immunologically competent cells of the donor are transplanted into immunocompromised recipients, and donor cells recognise antigens in the host and attack them.   This is seen in HSC transplantation, transplantation of solid organs rich in lymphoid cells (e.g., liver), or transfusion of unirradiated blood.   Immunocompetent T cells in donor tissue recognise the recipient’s HLA antigens as foreign and react against them.   Acute GVHD occurs within days to weeks after allogeneic HSC transplantation. Major affected organs: skin (rash), liver (jaundice), and intestines (diarrhoea).   Major affected organs: skin (rash), liver (jaundice), and intestines (diarrhoea).   Major affected organs: skin (rash), liver (jaundice), and intestines (diarrhoea).   Chronic GVHD can lead to fibrosis and long-term complications.   Prevention includes T-cell depletion of donor cells before transfusion or bone marrow transplantation.   In acute/ chronic graft rejection, the recipient's immune system attacks the graft; while in GVHD, donor T cells attack the recipient's HLA antigens.   Acute/ chronic graft rejection presents as the failure of graft function, local site inflammation and fever. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) (Option D):   Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is an exaggerated immune response that occurs in HIV-infected patients after antiretroviral therapy (ART).   HIV patients are immunocompromised, so if TB infection occurs in them, there is less inflammatory response in the body against TB.   But if ART therapy is given before ATT, their immunity improves and an exaggerated immune response occurs against TB leading to IRIS.   To prevent IRIS, ATT therapy is started first in patients diagnosed with HIV + TB, and 2 weeks later ART therapy is begun.   IRIS can also occur in transplant recipients after immunosuppression withdrawal."

          "D": "C4d"
        },
        "answer": 4,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: 4) C4d Explanation: C4d is a cleaved fragment of the complement protein C4 and serves as a distinctive indicator of endothelial damage, marking antibody activity. Its detection in peritubular capillaries is linked to the antibody-mediated rejection process in acute humoral rejection. Image: Immunoperoxidase stain shows C4d deposition in peritubular capillaries and a glomerulus. C3d (Option A): C3d is a breakdown product of the complement component C3 and can indicate complement activation, but it is not the most specific marker for antibody-mediated rejection. C5a (Option B): C5a is an anaphylatoxin produced during complement activation that has potent inflammatory effects and can recruit neutrophils and macrophages. While it plays a role in inflammation, it is not typically used as a histological marker for antibody-mediated rejection. C3b (Option C): C3b is another breakdown product of C3 and acts as an opsonin that promotes phagocytosis and further complement activation. It is not explicitly used as a marker for antibody-mediated rejection in transplant patients."

          "D": "Its morphologic correlate in the lung is bronchiolitis obliterans"
        },
        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct answer: A) Predominantly antibody-mediated reaction Explanation:   The clinical scenario suggests chronic transplant rejection, which is predominantly mediated by T cells, not antibodies. T cells react against graft alloantigens and secrete cytokines that stimulate fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells in the graft.   Chronic graft rejection is a type 4 > 2 hypersensitivity reaction.   The patient's symptoms appear four years post-transplant, which is consistent with chronic rejection. Chronic rejection typically occurs months to years after transplantation.   While antibodies can play a role in chronic rejection, the primary mechanism involves T cell-mediated inflammation and fibrosis. (Option A)   Histological: Chronic rejection is characterised by interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and vascular changes, which are more consistent with cell-mediated processes than antibody-mediated damage.   Chronic rejection leads to gradual loss of graft function over time, which aligns with the patient's presentation of oliguria after four years.   Contrast with acute rejection: Acute rejection typically occurs earlier (within 6 months) post-transplant and has different histological features.   Chronic graft rejection is the most common cause of graft failure. Graft arteriosclerosis is caused by T-cell cytokines and antibody deposition in chronic graft rejection."

        },
        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Option B - Alternate RNA splicing:   The co-expression of IgM and IgD after class switching is due to alternate RNA splicing.   The primary reason IgM and IgD are co-expressed on the surface of B cells after class switching is that class switching involves the recombination of constant region genes, but it does not alter the variable region of the antibody.   The variable region is responsible for antigen specificity, and it remains the same even after class switching. Incorrect Options: Option A - Allelic exclusion:   Allelic exclusion is a mechanism that ensures that a B cell expresses antibodies derived from only one of its two parental alleles.   It helps maintain the specificity of the B cell receptor on a single B cell. Option C - Somatic hypermutation:   Somatic hypermutation is a process that introduces random mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes.   This mechanism increases the diversity of antibodies during an immune response. Option D - Affinity maturation:   Affinity maturation is a process during which B cells with higher-affinity receptors for an antigen are selected and survive, leading to an improved antibody-antigen interaction.   It occurs through somatic hypermutation."

Unlike true anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions are triggered by non-immunologic mechanisms, such as the direct activation of mast cells or the complement system. Incorrect Options: Option A - Involves degranulation of mast cells:   Anaphylactoid reactions involve the rapid release of mediators, such as histamine, from mast cells and basophils.

        "solution": "Correct Option A - Anti CTLA-4 Ab is a new modality in the treatment of advanced cancers:   Immune surveillance refers to the process by which the immune system detects and eliminates cancerous cells in the body.   It plays a crucial role in protecting against the development and progression of cancer.   CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) is a checkpoint protein that negatively regulates T-cell activation.   Antibodies targeting CTLA-4, such as ipilimumab, have been developed as immunotherapeutic agents and have shown promising results in the treatment of advanced cancers by enhancing the anti-tumor immune response. Incorrect Options: Option B - Mutation of tumor suppressor genes decreases antigen toxicity:   Tumor suppressor genes play a critical role in regulating cell growth and preventing the development of cancer.   Mutations in tumor suppressor genes can lead to the loss of their normal functions, resulting in increased susceptibility to tumor formation, not decreased antigen toxicity. Option C - PD1/PDL1 activation leading to tumor suppression:   PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) and PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) are immune checkpoint proteins involved in regulating immune responses.   Activation of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can inhibit T-cell activity and promote immune tolerance, which can actually facilitate tumor growth and progression rather than tumor suppression. Option D - Binding of CD28 leads to immune tolerance:   CD28 is a co-stimulatory molecule expressed on T cells that plays a crucial role in T-cell activation and proliferation.   The binding of CD28 to its ligands on antigen-presenting cells provides a co-stimulatory signal necessary for the activation of T cells.   It does not lead to immune tolerance but rather promotes immune activation and response against antigens."

        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Option C - Isograft:   An isograft refers to a graft or transplant of tissue between genetically identical individuals, such as identical twins.   Since identical twins share the same genetic makeup, an isograft has the highest chance of success with minimal risk of rejection.   The immune system recognizes the transplanted tissue as its own and does not mount an immune response against it. Incorrect Options: Option A - Allograft:   An allograft refers to a graft or transplant of tissue between individuals of the same species but with different genetic makeup, such as between two non-identical humans.   It involves matching certain tissue compatibility factors (such as blood type and human leukocyte antigens) to minimize the risk of rejection.   In an allograft, there is a possibility of immune rejection due to genetic differences between the donor and recipient. Option B - Autograft:   An autograft is a graft or transplant of tissue from one part of an individual's body to another part.   In an autograft, the donor and recipient are the same person.   Autografts are often used because they have a very low risk of rejection since the tissue is taken from the individual's own body. Option D - Xenograft:   A xenograft refers to a graft or transplant of tissue between individuals of different species.   For example, if tissue from an animal is transplanted into a human, it would be considered a xenograft.

        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Option B - Type-4 Hypersensitivity Reaction:   The presentation of a cavitary lesion on the right lung apex with caseous necrosis suggests pulmonary tuberculosis.   In pulmonary tuberculosis, the underlying pathophysiology involves a type-4 hypersensitivity reaction, also known as a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction.   In the case of tuberculosis, the immune response is characterized by the activation of T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ T cells.   These T cells recognize antigens presented by macrophages infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.   The activated CD4+ T cells release cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), which leads to the recruitment of macrophages to the site of infection.   The activated macrophages attempt to eliminate the bacteria through phagocytosis.   However, Mycobacterium tuberculosis has the ability to survive within the phagosomes of macrophages and evade complete destruction.   This results in the formation of granulomas, which are organized collections of macrophages surrounded by T cells.   Within the granulomas, there is central caseous necrosis, characterized by a cheese-like appearance.   The type 4 hypersensitivity reaction is responsible for the tissue damage seen in tuberculosis. Incorrect Options: Option A - Enzyme degradation:   While enzymes may be involved in the breakdown of tissue during the course of infection, the primary mechanism of tissue damage in tuberculosis is the type-4 hypersensitivity reaction. Option C - Fibrinoid deposition:   Fibrinoid deposition refers to the accumulation of fibrin-like material in the walls of blood vessels.   It is typically associated with conditions such as vasculitis. Option D - Sudden cutoff of blood supply:   The sudden cutoff of blood supply, also known as infarction, occurs when the blood supply to a tissue is abruptly interrupted, leading to ischemia and subsequent tissue death.   In the case of tuberculosis, the tissue damage is primarily caused by the immune response and the formation of granulomas."

          "D": "CD3"
        },
        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Option A - Lipids without MHC proteins:   Gamma delta T cell (γδ) receptors are capable of recognizing lipids without the need for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins.   This means that γδ T cells can directly interact with certain lipids, glycolipids, and phospholipids, allowing them to respond to lipid antigens independently of MHC presentation. Incorrect Options: Option B - Peptides with MHC proteins:   Alpha beta T cell receptors (αβ TCRs) are predominantly responsible for recognizing peptide antigens, which are typically presented by MHC molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs).   Peptides derived from pathogens or abnormal cellular processes are presented by MHC molecules, and αβ TCRs bind to these peptide-MHC complexes to initiate an immune response. Option C - CD20:   CD20 is a cell surface protein expressed primarily on the surface of B cells.   It is not directly related to the recognition of antigens by T-cell receptors.   CD20 is mainly targeted by therapeutic antibodies in the treatment of certain B-cell lymphomas and autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Option D - CD3:   CD3 is a complex of proteins associated with the T cell receptor (TCR) on the surface of T cells.   It is involved in the signal transduction process upon TCR engagement with peptide-MHC complexes.   CD3 proteins transmit activation signals to the T cell when the TCR recognizes its specific antigen, leading to T cell activation and an immune response.   CD3 is not directly responsible for antigen recognition but is crucial for T-cell signalling."

        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Fibrosis in periportal areas of the liver Explanation:   Fibrosis in the periportal areas of the liver is typically seen in chronic liver diseases caused by factors like viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or autoimmune hepatitis, not in right-sided heart failure.   In severe right-sided heart failure, fibrosis occurs in the central areas of the liver (centrilobular fibrosis) due to chronic hypoxia or congestion affecting the central veins within the liver lobules and is known as Cardiac cirrhosis. Options A, B, and D are the pathological changes seen in Right-sided heart failure. Nutmeg liver appearance (Option A):   In severe right-sided heart failure, the central veins become congested with blood due to systemic venous congestion, leading to red-brown pericentral zones and relatively normal-coloured tan periportal regions, resulting in a characteristic appearance known as a \" Nutmeg liver.\"   This congestion can lead to hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes, and, eventually, centrilobular necrosis. Pretibial oedema (Option B):   Pretibial oedema is indeed a hallmark of right-sided heart failure due to fluid accumulation in the dependent areas of the body. Congestive splenomegaly (Option D):   Enlargement of the spleen can occur as a result of portal hypertension secondary to right-sided heart failure, leading to increased pressure in the portal venous system and splenic sequestration of platelets."

        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Cardiac-specific troponin I (cTnI) Explanation:   Cardiac-specific troponins (cTnT and cTnI) are highly specific biomarkers for myocardial damage and are considered the gold standard for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction (MI).   They are proteins that regulate calcium-mediated contraction in cardiac muscle.   Elevated cTn levels above threshold levels are more specific to “myocardial injury” than ischemia but not to acute coronary syndrome (ACS); hence, elevated cTn levels should be interpreted alongside the patient's clinical history and ECG findings.   Troponin levels start to rise within 2-4 hours after myocardial infarction, peak at 24-48 hours and can remain elevated for several days.   Troponin levels are important for risk stratification after both ST-elevation Myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST elevation Myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).   Troponin is also the best marker for reinfarction and a ≥20% rise from baseline during serial monitoring indicates reinfarction."

        },
        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) RHD commonly affects the pulmonary valve, resulting in valvular stenosis or regurgitation. Explanation: Pulmonary is the least common valve affected by rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The mitral valve is most commonly affected.   RHD is a condition that develops as a complication of untreated or inadequately treated acute rheumatic fever (ARF), which is caused by an abnormal immune response to an infection with Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus bacteria (aka Streptococcus pyogenes) (Option A is ruled out).   Group A Streptococcus M protein resembles human cardiac tissues, leading to autoimmune attack on heart valves.   The bacteria trigger an immune response that leads to chronic inflammation and scarring of heart valves (Option C is ruled out), commonly affecting the mitral valve.   Cross-Immunity: Different serotypes of Group A Streptococcus have variable M proteins, so previous infection does not provide complete immunity, making recurrent streptococcal infections a risk for repeated rheumatic fever episodes and progressive RHD.   Early treatment of streptococcal infections with antibiotics can help prevent initial rheumatic fever and subsequent rheumatic heart disease (Option D is ruled out).   However, once RHD is established, ongoing cardiac monitoring and sometimes surgical intervention are needed to manage valve damage and related complications."

This bacterial infection can lead to acute rheumatic fever, typically developing 2-3 weeks after the onset of streptococcal pharyngitis, eventually progressing to RHD.   The most commonly affected age group is 5-15 years. Streptococcal skin infections (Option B) (e.g., impetigo) can also be associated with rheumatic fever but are less commonly a trigger for rheumatic heart disease than pharyngitis.

This molecular mimicry produces antibodies and activates CD4+ T cells that ultimately cause inflammation and tissue damage, particularly in the heart.

        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Excessive release of catecholamines. Explanation :   Excessive release of catecholamines is the most likely underlying mechanism for the development of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in this patient.   Emotional or physical stress, such as the news of a family member's serious illness, can trigger a surge of catecholamines (e.g., adrenaline and noradrenaline).   Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an entity characterised by left ventricular contractile dysfunction after extreme psychological stress (thus also called broken heart syndrome)   Maximum catecholamine receptors are present in the left ventricle, leading to LV dilation.   Affected myocardium may be stunned or show contraction band necrosis, which can eventually progress to DCM.   The left ventricular apex is most often affected, leading to “apical ballooning” that resembles a takotsubo, Japanese for “fishing pot for trapping octopus”.   The mechanism of catecholamine cardiotoxicity likely relates either to direct myocyte toxicity due to calcium overload or to focal vasoconstriction in the coronary arterial macro- or microcirculation in the face of an increased heart rate."

It is the leading cause of left ventricular hypertrophy unexplained by other clinical or pathologic causes.   It is a leading cause of sudden death in the young and is an important cause of heart failure. Causes:   HCM is most commonly caused by mutations in any one of several genes that encode sarcomeric proteins.   There are more than 400 different known mutations in nine different genes, most being missense mutations.   Mutations causing HCM are found most commonly in the genes encoding myosin-binding protein C (MYBP-C) or β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC/MYH7), followed by the genes coding for cardiac TnI, TnT (Option C), and α-tropomyosin (Option D); overall, these account for 70% to 80% of all cases.

It is characterized by fibrosis of the ventricular endocardium and subendocardium that extends from the apex upward, often eventually involving the tricuspid and mitral valves.   The fibrous tissue markedly diminishes the volume and compliance of affected chambers, causing a restrictive functional defect.

Involved arterial segments develop intimal thickening   Classic lesions exhibit medial granulomatous inflammation centred on the internal elastic membrane with elastic lamina fragmentation; there is an infiltrate of T cells (CD4+ > CD8+) and macrophages.   Inflammatory lesions are only focally distributed along the vessel, and segments of relatively normal arteries may be interposed.   The Verhoeff-Van Gieson stain is used for internal elastic lamina (black). Biopsy and histological confirmation of the temporal artery is the investigation of choice. Treatment: Corticosteroids [Image not available] Takayasu arteritis (Option B)[Image not available] Histologically, the changes range from adventitial mononuclear infiltrates with perivascular cuffing of the vasa vasorum to intense mononuclear inflammation in the media. Granulomatous inflammation, replete with giant cells and patchy medial necrosis, is also seen. As the disease progresses, collagenous scarring, with admixed chronic inflammatory infiltrates, occurs in all three vessel wall layers. Polyarteritis nodosa (Option C)[Image not available] During the acute phase, transmural inflammation of the arterial wall with a mixed infiltrate of neutrophils, eosinophils, and mononuclear cells occurs, frequently accompanied by fibrinoid necrosis and luminal thrombosis.

        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Takayasu arteritis Explanation : The clinical presentation is suggestive of Takayasu arteritis. Takayasu arteritis:   Most common cause of renal artery stenosis in India → Leads to ostial narrowing, low GFR, and high renin hypertension.   Commonly affects the left subclavian artery → Causes arm claudication, unequal BP between arms, and weak radial pulse.   Investigation of choice → MR-Angiography (MRA).   Treatment → Steroids. Rheumatoid arthritis (Option A) primarily affects the joints and is not typically associated with pulse abnormalities or arterial involvement, as seen in Takayasu arteritis. Polyarteritis nodosa (Option C) is a necrotising vasculitis that predominantly affects medium-sized arteries.   It typically presents with systemic symptoms and may involve multiple organs, but it does not usually manifest with pulse abnormalities or arterial involvement in the upper extremities, as seen in Takayasu arteritis. Microscopic polyangiitis (Option D) is a small-vessel vasculitis characterised by necrotising inflammation affecting small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries.   While it shares some similarities with Takayasu arteritis regarding systemic symptoms and laboratory findings, it primarily involves small vessels and typically presents with renal involvement, pulmonary haemorrhage, and skin manifestations.

        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Thromboangiitis Obliterans Explanation : Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger’s disease) It is characterized by segmental, thrombosing, acute and chronic inflammation of medium and small-sized arteries, especially the tibial and radial arteries, that often leads to vascular insufficiency, typically of the extremities. Etiology Occurs almost exclusively in heavy cigarette smokers, usually before the age of 35 Pathology Affected vessels of thromboangiitis obliterans show acute and chronic inflammation, accompanied by luminal thrombosis. The inflammatory process extends into contiguous veins and nerves (rare with other forms of vasculitis), and with time, all three structures can be encased in fibrous tissue Clinical features Recurrent episodes of pain and discolouration in the extremities, particularly with exposure to cold, along with superficial migratory thrombophlebitis. Imaging Doppler ultrasound findings may reveal segmental occlusions in the affected arteries, supporting the diagnosis. Raynaud's phenomenon (Option B) is a vasospastic disorder causing episodic discoloration (white, blue, red) of the fingers and toes, typically triggered by cold or stress.   It is not associated with segmental arterial occlusions or migratory thrombophlebitis rather it occurs due to vasospasm of small arteries and arterioles Atherosclerosis (Option C) is a condition of large and medium-sized arteries characterized by plaque formation, leading to chronic narrowing of vessels, ischemia, and sometimes embolization.   It involves lipid deposition and chronic changes, whereas thromboangiitis obliterans involves acute and chronic inflammatory processes and is segmental in nature. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) (Option D) is a large-vessel vasculitis primarily affecting the temporal and other cranial arteries.   It is most common in individuals over the age of 50.   Symptoms include headache, jaw claudication, visual disturbances, and systemic signs such as fever and weight loss."

It involves inflammation and thrombosis of small and medium-sized arteries, particularly in the distal extremities, leading to ischemia and tissue damage. [Image not available] In the above image, the lumen is occluded by thrombin-containing abscesses, and the vessel wall is infiltrated with leukocytes. Segmental fibrinoid necrosis of the media with focal transmural necrotising lesions (Option A) is a hallmark feature of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), a systemic necrotizing vasculitis which affects medium-sized muscular arteries and is associated with fibrinoid necrosis and inflammation that spares arterioles, capillaries, and venules. Granulomatous inflammation of vessel walls (Option C) is a hallmark of large-vessel vasculitides, such as giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis.

        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Henoch-Schönlein Purpura Explanation : The clinical presentation of a 10-year-old child with palpable purpura, arthralgia, abdominal pain, elevated serum IgA levels, and RBC casts in urine is suggestive of Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP). Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (IgA vasculitis) It is a systemic vasculitis characterised by inflammation of small blood vessels, primarily affecting children, but can also occur in adults. Etiology Often follows upper respiratory tract infections Pathology Immune complex deposition of IgA in small blood vessels leads to inflammation Clinical features Inflammation of small blood vessels, primarily affecting children, but can also occur in adults. Associated with elevated serum IgA levels Skin: Palpable purpura, most prominently on the lower limbs and buttocks. Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia or arthritis, often transient and non-deforming. Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes gastrointestinal bleeding, Intussusception is a severe but rare complication. Renal: Hematuria, proteinuria, and red blood cell casts in urine. Can progress to IgA nephropathy in severe cases. Management Supportive care: Hydration, rest, and pain management with NSAIDs for arthralgia. Glucocorticoids: For severe abdominal pain, renal involvement, or systemic symptoms. Intussusception: Surgical intervention if required. Nephritis: Immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclophosphamide) in severe cases.

        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Wegener's Granulomatosis Explanation : The clinical presentation of a 55-year-old female with hematuria, hemoptysis, sinusitis, and renal biopsy showing pauci-immune necrotising crescentic glomerulonephritis is suggestive of Wegener’s granulomatosis. Wegener's Granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis-GPA):   It is characterised by pauci-immune necrotising granulomatous vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized vessels.   It commonly involves the respiratory tract (sinusitis, pulmonary nodules, haemorrhage) and kidneys (rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis).   The presence of pauci-immune necrotising crescentic glomerulonephritis on renal biopsy is highly suggestive of GPA.   In GPA, there is a presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), specifically cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) targeting proteinase 3 (PR3). Goodpasture Syndrome(Option B) is an autoimmune disorder characterised by the presence of antibodies targeting the basement membrane of the kidneys and lungs.   Clinical features often include rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (similar to GPA) along with pulmonary haemorrhage.   It is characterised by the presence of anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies.   The renal biopsy findings in Goodpasture Syndrome typically show linear IgG deposition along the glomerular basement membrane. SLE(Option C) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and cardiovascular system.   While SLE can involve the kidneys (lupus nephritis), pulmonary involvement in SLE may manifest differently than in GPA (e.g., pleuritis, pulmonary hypertension) and is not typically associated with the pauci-immune vasculitis seen in GPA.   Laboratory findings in SLE often include positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (anti-dsDNA), and specific criteria for lupus nephritis. Microscopic polyangiitis(Option D) (MPA) is another type of small-vessel vasculitis characterized by pauci-immune necrotizing vasculitis.   Differentiating features include the absence of granulomatous inflammation seen in GPA and differences in the ANCA pattern (perinuclear ANCA or p-ANCA) targeting myeloperoxidase (MPO) rather than PR3.

        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Microscopic Polyangiitis Explanation : The clinical presentation of rapidly progressive hematuria, hemoptysis, peripheral neuropathy, and MPO positivity points towards the diagnosis of microscopic polyangiitis. Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA):   It is a small vessel vasculitis affecting the capillaries, arterioles, and venules.   It typically spares the medium-sized and larger arteries hence infarcts are uncommon.   All the lesions are of the same age in any given patient and are distributed more widely.   Clinical features include palpable cutaneous purpura, hemoptysis, hematuria, and proteinuria.   Serologically, MPA is associated with the presence of perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) targeting myeloperoxidase (MPO), a key enzyme in neutrophils.   Morphology:   Granulomatous inflammation is absent.   In some areas (typically postcapillary venules), only infiltrating and fragmenting neutrophils are seen, giving rise to leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Option B)is typically associated with c-ANCA (anti-proteinase 3 antibodies), not p-ANCA.   It presents with granulomatous inflammation, often involving the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and renal involvement. Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA) (Option C), formerly known as Churg-Strauss Syndrome, is a systemic vasculitis characterised by eosinophilic infiltration, granulomatous inflammation, and vasculitis affecting small to medium-sized vessels.   It usually is associated with p-ANCA but often involves eosinophilia and asthma. Goodpasture Syndrome (Option D) is characterized by anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies, not p-ANCA.   It presents with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage, resulting in hemoptysis, but does not typically include peripheral neuropathy."

        "solution": "Correct Option A - Troponin I:   Troponin I is the most sensitive and specific marker used in diagnosing myocardial infarction.   Troponin I is a regulatory protein found in cardiac muscle cells, and its release into the bloodstream is a specific indicator of cardiac muscle damage.   Elevated troponin I levels in the blood indicate cardiac cell death, which occurs during a heart attack. Incorrect Options: Option B - Cytokeratin:   Cytokeratin is a protein found in epithelial cells and is not specific to cardiac muscle. Option C - Myoglobin:   Myoglobin is an oxygen-binding protein found in muscle tissues, including cardiac muscle.   While it can be released into the bloodstream during a heart attack, it is not as specific or sensitive as troponin I for diagnosing myocardial infarction. Option D - CK-MB:   CK-MB is an enzyme found predominantly in cardiac muscle cells.   Elevated CK-MB levels can indicate cardiac muscle damage, including myocardial infarction.

        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Option C - Sudden cardiac death due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy:   Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is characterized by abnormal heart muscle thickening, particularly in the left ventricle.   The autopsy image shows signs of cardiac hypertrophy, which is suggestive of HCM as the cause of death.   HCM is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes. Incorrect Options: Option A - Valvular heart disease due to RHD:   The autopsy image shows no significant abnormalities in the heart valves, ruling out valvular heart disease as the cause of death.   Rheumatic heart disease is a condition that results from untreated or inadequately treated streptococcal infections, leading to inflammation and scarring of the heart valves.   Typical findings in RHD include thickened or damaged heart valves, which are not evident in the image. Option B - Sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmia:   Sudden cardiac death is an unexpected and abrupt loss of heart function, usually resulting from a life-threatening arrhythmia.   In athletes, the most common cause of SCD is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), characterized by abnormal heart muscle thickening. Option D - Sudden cardiac death due to atherosclerosis:   Atherosclerosis is the buildup of plaques in the arteries, which narrows and impairs blood flow.

It involves obtaining a small tissue sample from the endocardium or the myocardium to examine it under a microscope.   This biopsy allows for direct visualization of the cardiac tissue and assessment of cellular inflammation, the presence of viral particles, and other histopathological changes characteristic of myocarditis. Incorrect Options: Option B - Magnetic Resonance Imaging:   While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide supportive evidence for the diagnosis of myocarditis, it is not considered the gold standard investigation.   Cardiac MRI can demonstrate myocardial edema, inflammation, and tissue characterization using specific sequences, such as T2-weighted imaging and late gadolinium enhancement. Option C - Brain Natriuretic Peptide:   Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a hormone released by the heart in response to increased stretching of cardiac chambers, typically seen in conditions such as heart failure.   While BNP levels can be elevated in myocarditis due to associated cardiac dysfunction, it is not a specific diagnostic test for myocarditis. Option D - LDH1 to LDH2 ratio:   The LDH1 to LDH2 ratio is not a specific diagnostic test for myocarditis.   Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme found in various tissues, including the heart.

        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct answer: C) Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency Explanation:   Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic condition characterized by low levels or dysfunctional alpha-1 antitrypsin protein. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency:   It is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the alpha-1 antitrypsin gene located on Chromosome 14.   Normal individuals have the PiMM genotype, while those with the disease have the PiZZ genotype.   This results in significantly reduced levels of functional alpha-1 antitrypsin protein.   Carriers possess the PiMZ genotype.   The condition primarily affects the lungs, leading to panacinar emphysema and the liver, causing cirrhosis due to abnormal protein accumulation. Cystic fibrosis (Option A) is a genetic disorder caused by CFTR gene mutations, leading to thick mucus, chronic lung infections, and bronchiectasis.   While it causes obstructive lung disease, emphysema is not typical. Asthma (Option B) is a chronic inflammatory condition causing reversible airway obstruction and episodic wheezing, coughing, and breathlessness.   It does not typically result in emphysema or structural lung damage. Bronchiectasis (Option D) is a condition of permanently dilated bronchi due to chronic infections or inflammation.

Explanation:   Chronic inflammation in emphysema does lead to the accumulation of T and B cells in affected parts of the lung, but the role of adaptive immunity is currently uncertain.   Therefore, it's not considered a defining feature of the disease. Pathophysiology of emphysema:   Inhaled cigarette smoke and other noxious particles cause damage to respiratory epithelium and inflammation, resulting in parenchymal destruction, which is a hallmark of emphysema.   In patients with emphysema, there is often a relative deficiency of protective antiproteases, which allows proteases released from inflammatory cells and epithelial cells to break down connective tissue components, contributing to tissue destruction.   Substances in tobacco smoke, alveolar damage, and inflammatory cells all produce oxidants, which contribute to tissue damage, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation, further exacerbating the pathology of emphysema."

        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct answer: B) Emphysema Explanation:   The patient's history of heavy smoking, chronic cough with occasional scanty sputum production, progressive shortness of breath, especially with exertion and physical examination showing barrel-shaped chest, decreased breath sounds, and a prolonged expiratory phase is highly suggestive of COPD with emphysema.   Clinically significant emphysema is largely confined to smokers and patients with α 1-antitrypsin deficiency. Clinical features:   The classical presentation of emphysema involves a barrel-shaped chest and dyspnea, with obviously prolonged expiration, sitting forward in a hunched-over position, and breathing through pursed lips.   Cough is often slight, overdistention of the lungs is severe, diffusion capacity is low, and blood gas values are relatively normal at rest.   Weight loss is common and can be so severe as to suggest an occult cancer. Chronic bronchitis (Option A) presents insidiously with slowly increasing dyspnea on exertion and chronic cough with sputum production, slight at first but increasing over time.   The most important diagnostic test is spirometry, which typically shows an FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.7.   The main clinically distinguishing factor between emphysema and chronic bronchitis is that chronic bronchitis is characterized by a persistent, mucus-producing cough. In contrast, the primary symptom of emphysema is shortness of breath. Bronchitis Emphysema Age (years) 40–45 50–75 Dyspnea Mild; late Severe; early Cough Early; copious sputum Late; scanty sputum Infections Common Occasional Respiratory insufficiency Early, periodic End-stage, unremitting Cor pulmonale Common Uncommon, end-stage Airway resistance Increased Normal or slightly increased Elastic recoil Normal Low Chest radiograph Prominent vessels; large heart size Hyperinflation; normal heart size Appearance Blue bloater Pink puffer Pulmonary fibrosis (Option C) is characterized by progressive scarring of the lungs, leading to decreased lung compliance and restrictive lung disease.   The chest X-ray findings of hyperinflated, hyperlucent lungs are not consistent with pulmonary fibrosis.

        "solution": "Correct answer: C) Chronic bronchitis Explanation:   The patient's symptoms of chronic cough, increased sputum production, and shortness of breath, combined with his history of long-term smoking, are highly suggestive of chronic bronchitis.   Chronic bronchitis is a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) characterized by persistent cough and mucus production.   The critical diagnostic criteria for chronic bronchitis are cough and sputum production for at least 3 months per year for two consecutive years without any other identifiable cause.   This distinguishes chronic bronchitis from acute bronchitis, which is a temporary condition.   Cause of chronic bronchitis: Smoking Air pollution Occupational exposures (dust, chemicals, fumes) Recurrent respiratory infections Indoor biomass fuel exposure Chronic exposure to environmental irritants   Smoking   Air pollution   Occupational exposures (dust, chemicals, fumes)   Recurrent respiratory infections   Indoor biomass fuel exposure   Chronic exposure to environmental irritants   Smoking   Air pollution   Occupational exposures (dust, chemicals, fumes)   Recurrent respiratory infections   Indoor biomass fuel exposure   Chronic exposure to environmental irritants Pathogenesis:   Longstanding bronchitis commonly leads to pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, and death due to heart failure.   Treatment options include smoking cessation, oxygen therapy, long-acting bronchodilators with inhaled corticosteroids, antibiotics, and physical therapy. Emphysema (Option A):   Characterized by the destruction of the alveoli in the lungs, leading to airflow obstruction.   While emphysema can co-occur with chronic bronchitis, the patient's primary symptoms of chronic cough and increased sputum production indicate more chronic bronchitis. Asthma (Option B):   Characterized by intermittent symptoms that worsen with triggers rather than the persistent, progressive symptoms described in the case. Lung cancer (Option D):   Lung cancer can also present with cough and shortness of breath, but the gradual, chronic nature of the patient's symptoms makes lung cancer a less likely diagnosis compared to chronic bronchitis."

Explanation:   Recurrent, episodic attacks of wheezing, prolonged expiration, dyspnea (shortness of breath), and chest tightness are seen in asthma.   Chronic bronchitis is defined clinically as persistent cough with sputum production for at least 3 months in at least 2 consecutive years in the absence of any other identifiable cause.   Reid's Index: RI = Thickness of submucosal gland layer / overall thickness of the wall   The Reid index (normally 0.4) is increased in chronic bronchitis (>0.4), usually in proportion to the severity and duration of the disease. Histopathology:   Chronic inflammation of the airways (predominantly lymphocytes and macrophages).   Thickening of the bronchiolar wall due to smooth muscle hypertrophy.   Deposition of extracellular matrix in the muscle layer.   Peribronchial fibrosis.   Goblet cell hyperplasia.   Enlargement of the mucus-secreting glands of the trachea and bronchi.

        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Horner syndrome Explanation:   The patient's presentation and the presence of a lung apex mass involving nearby neurovascular structures suggests a Pancoast tumour (superior sulcus tumour) located at the apex of the lung, typically involving nearby neurovascular structures.   Compression or invasion of nearby nerves, including the sympathetic chain, can result in Horner syndrome, characterised by a combination of ptosis (drooping eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), and anhidrosis (lack of sweating) on the affected side of the face and sometimes enophthalmos (sunken appearance of the eyeball). Superior vena cava syndrome (Option B):   SVC syndrome is characterised by symptoms related to compression or obstruction of the superior vena cava, typically by a tumour in the mediastinum leading to facial swelling, dilated veins, and other signs of venous congestion but not neurological manifestations. Caplan syndrome (Option C):   Caplan syndrome is the combination of rheumatoid arthritis and pneumoconiosis (Coal workers' pneumoconiosis) with characteristic pulmonary nodules.   It is not associated with any neurological symptoms. Carcinoid syndrome (Option D):   Carcinoid syndrome is associated with symptoms such as flushing, diarrhoea, and wheezing due to the release of vasoactive substances from carcinoid tumours, and it has no association with neurological manifestations."

        },
        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Sugar tumour (PEComa) Explanation:   The clinical scenario of a well-circumscribed lung mass with calcifications and histological features of spindle and epithelioid cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, perivascular growth pattern, and positivity for HMB-45 immunostaining is highly suggestive of a sugar tumour.   It is also known as a perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa). PEComa   It is a rare mesenchymal tumour.   It can lead to cystic, emphysema-like dilation of terminal airspaces and obstruction of lymphatic vessels.   Treatment involves surgical resection, and mTOR inhibitors are considered for un-resectable or metastatic cases. Pulmonary hamartomas (Option A):   Pulmonary hamartomas are benign lung tumours of mesenchymal and epithelial components like cartilage, fat, and fibrous tissue.   They are often discovered incidentally on imaging scans as small, well-defined, rounded opacities (coin lesions).   Microscopically, they show nodules of connective tissue with epithelial clefts, often containing cartilage and lined by ciliated or non-ciliated epithelium. Solitary fibrous tumour (Option C):   Solitary fibrous tumours are rare mesenchymal tumours of the lung and are well-circumscribed masses composed of spindle and epithelioid cells.   They typically stain positive for CD34 and STAT6, with a favourable prognosis after surgical resection. Carcinoid tumor (Option D):   Carcinoid tumours are neuroendocrine tumours typically manifest as polypoid masses in the bronchi.   Their histopathological features include the nesting of cells with uniform round nuclei, moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm, and chromatin's characteristic 'salt and pepper' appearance within the nuclei.   These tumours stain positive for neuroendocrine markers like Synaptophysin and Chromogranin."

Microscopi c appearan ceSpindle cells are arranged in whorls among reticulin and collagen fibres.Variable: Epithelioid (tubular/papillary structures), sarcomatoid (fibrosarcoma-like), or biphasic Calretinin (Option B):   Calretinin is a calcium-binding protein commonly used as a marker for mesothelioma.   It is typically expressed in the epithelial and some biphasic types of mesothelioma but is not usually expressed in solitary fibrous tumours. WT1 (Wilms' tumour 1) (Option C):   WT1 is another frequently positive marker in mesothelioma, particularly in epithelial mesothelioma.   This marker, however, is not usually expressed in solitary fibrous tumours. TTF-1 (Thyroid transcription factor 1) (Option D):   TTF-1 is primarily used to identify carcinoma of lung and thyroid origin and is not useful for distinguishing between solitary fibrous tumours and mesothelioma.   TTF-1 is positive in the adenocarcinoma of the lung."

        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Both glandular and squamous differentiation are seen Explanation:   The clinical presentation and histological features described suggest small-cell lung carcinoma, a highly malignant neuroendocrine tumour with a strong relationship to cigarette smoking.   Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) primarily exhibits neuroendocrine characteristics without the glandular histological features seen in adenocarcinoma or the squamous differentiation seen in squamous cell carcinoma. Encrustation of tumour cells along the blood vessels with DNA material(Option B)   The encrustation of necrotic tumour cells along the blood vessels with DNA material causes basophilic staining of vascular walls.   It is known as the ‘Azzopardi effect’, a characteristic feature often observed in Small-cell lung carcinoma. Presence of dense neurosecretory granules on electron microscopy (Option C):   Small-cell lung carcinoma shows neuroendocrine differentiation and dense neurosecretory granules on electron microscopy.

Pulmonary hypertension results from vascular remodelling and vasoconstriction in the pulmonary arterioles, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and elevated pulmonary arterial pressure.   Manifestations include exertional dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, syncope, right heart failure with jugular venous distension, and peripheral oedema. Causes of Pulmonary hypertension   High altitude (Chronic hypoxia) (Option A)   Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)   Interstitial lung disease (e.g., Pulmonary fibrosis)   Left Heart Failure (e.g. Mitral stenosis, Systolic dysfunction)   Recurrent thromboembolism events (Pulmonary embolism) (Option B)   Autoimmune diseases (e.g. Systemic sclerosis) (Option C)   Congenital Heart Disease (e.g. Atrial Septal Defect; Eisenmenger Syndrome)   Obstructive Sleep apnea High altitude (Option A):   Living at high altitudes with reduced oxygen can lead to pulmonary hypertension as: Recurrent thromboembolic events (Option B):   Repeated pulmonary embolisms can obstruct blood vessels in the lungs, increasing pulmonary vascular resistance and causing pulmonary hypertension.

        },
        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Hypercalcemia Explanation:   The given clinical presentation and histological findings point towards the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, one of the major subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer,   which typically arises from the central bronchi and can cause symptoms like coughing, chest pain, and hemoptysis.   Hypercalcemia is the most common paraneoplastic syndrome associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.   SCC of the lung can produce parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), leading to elevated calcium levels in the blood.   This condition is characterised by symptoms such as fatigue, confusion, excessive thirst and urination, and nausea. Type of Lung Carcinoma Paraneoplastic Syndrome Squamous cell carcinoma Hypercalcemia Adenocarcinoma Migratory thrombophlebitis (Trousseau syndrome) Small cell or oat cell Carcinoma SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion) Cushing's syndrome Lambert eaton syndrome Large cell carcinoma Gynaecomastia Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH) (Option B):   It is more commonly associated with small cell lung cancer rather than SCC.   SIADH leads to excessive release of antidiuretic hormone, causing water retention and dilutional hyponatremia, which can result in symptoms like muscle cramps, nausea, headaches, and disorientation. Migratory thrombophlebitis (also known as Trousseau’s syndrome) (Option C):   While this can be seen in many types of cancers, it is typically more associated with adenocarcinoma rather than with SCC.   This syndrome involves the formation of blood clots that migrate within the venous system. Cushing's syndrome (Option D):   It is characterised by the ectopic production of ACTH, most frequently associated with small cell lung cancer, not SCC.   Patients may experience symptoms such as weight gain, muscle weakness, and a rounded face (moon face)."

        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Adenocarcinoma in situ Explanation:   The histopathological image shows a localised proliferation of dysplastic cells along pre-existing alveolar septa, indicative of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) or bronchioloalveolar carcinoma which is a precancerous lesion of adenocarcinoma of the lung with severe cytologic atypia.   AIS is an early stage of lung cancer where abnormal glandular cells are confined to the airway lining without invasion and exhibit a “lepidic growth pattern” (or butterfly on fence pattern), spreading along intact alveolar structures without invasion.   Lesions are usually small, measuring ≤ 3 cm. Carcinoma in situ (Option A):   Carcinoma in situ involves abnormal squamous cells confined to the epithelium without invading the surrounding structures. Adenomatous hyperplasia (Option B):   Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) is a precursor lesion of lung adenocarcinoma with mild cytologic atypia, characterised by dysplastic pneumocytes lining alveolar walls.   These lesions are typically small, ≤5 mm, and can be single or multiple.   AAH may be adjacent to invasive tumours or independently within the lung tissue and signifies an initial stage in adenocarcinoma development. Diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (Option D):   DIPNECH (Diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia) is a preneoplastic condition characterised by the abnormal proliferation of neuroendocrine cells in the lungs, which can progress to develop into neuroendocrine tumours over time like small cell carcinoma and carcinoid tumours."

        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Smoking has no association with adenocarcinoma of the lung. Explanation:   Smoking significantly increases the risk of adenocarcinoma of the lung, although to a lesser extent than other types.   Adenocarcinoma, commonly found in non-smokers, can still occur due to tobacco smoking.   It often involves mutations in growth factor receptor pathways and is the most prevalent subtype in non-smokers. Smoking is a major risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (Option A):   Smoking significantly increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung as it has a strong association, resulting in chromosomal deletions involving tumour suppressor loci involving 3p,9p and 17p. Smoking is a significant risk factor for small-cell lung carcinoma (Option C):   Small-cell carcinoma is almost always linked to smoking, exhibiting the highest mutation rate among lung cancers.   SCLC is almost exclusively caused by smoking and usually involves the inactivation of both TP53 and RB genes. Asbestosis exposure, along with smoking, multiplies the risk of lung cancer (Option D):   Asbestos exposure, especially when combined with smoking, significantly raises the risk of lung cancer.   Non-smokers exposed to asbestos have a five-fold higher risk, while smokers have a 55-fold increased risk compared to non-smokers."

These membranes comprise fibrin-rich oedema fluid mixed with remnants of necrotic epithelial cells, representing a hallmark feature of acute lung injury and ARDS. Pathological changes seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Stage Features 1. Acute Exudative Stage Lungs appear heavy, firm, red, and boggy. Manifestations include congestion, interstitial and intra-alveolar oedema, inflammation, fibrin deposition, and diffuse alveolar damage. Alveolar walls are lined with “waxy hyaline membranes” composed of fibrin-rich oedema fluid mixed with remnants of necrotic epithelial cells. 2. Proliferative or Organizing StageProliferation of Type II pneumocytes. Granulation tissue forms in the alveolar walls and spaces. 3.

        },
        "answer": 4,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: D) Pulmonary arterioles show medial hypertrophy and intimal fibrosis, narrowing the lumens. Explanation:   The patient's clinical presentation with symptoms of right heart failure, elevated jugular venous pressure, and findings of right ventricular hypertrophy and dilation on echocardiography suggest pulmonary hypertension.   Histopathologically, pulmonary hypertension is characterised by the remodelling of pulmonary arterioles, which typically exhibit medial hypertrophy (thickening of the smooth muscle layer) and intimal fibrosis.   These changes lead to the narrowing of the vessel lumens, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and subsequent right heart strain. BMPR2 mutations result in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis. (Option A):   BMPR2 mutations are associated with familial pulmonary arterial hypertension, commonly associated with dysregulation of endothelial and vascular cellular processes involved in vascular homeostasis, including aberrant proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. Classic atherosclerotic changes are commonly observed in pulmonary arteries. (Option B):   Classic atherosclerotic changes, such as plaque formation and lipid deposition, are not typical findings in pulmonary arteries affected by pulmonary hypertension. Plexiform lesions are early changes of pulmonary hypertension. (Option C):   Plexiform lesions are characterised by tufts of capillary formations that are more specific to certain types of pulmonary hypertension, particularly in idiopathic and familial cases.   Plexiform lesions of small arteries are characteristic of advanced pulmonary hypertension rather than early changes."

It commonly afflicts debilitated and malnourished people, particularly chronic alcoholics.   Thick, mucoid (often blood-tinged) sputum is characteristic because the organism produces an abundant viscid capsular polysaccharide, which the patient may have difficulty expectorating. Mycoplasma Pneumonia (Option A)   Mycoplasma pneumonia causes atypical pneumonia with dry cough, fever, and fatigue.   It often presents with mild symptoms but can lead to complications.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a 45-year-old male with a persistent cough, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, and chest X-ray showing an infiltrate in the upper lobe of the right lung is suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis. Th2-mediated macrophage activation and bacteria killing is not seen in tuberculosis. Rather, a Th-1-mediated response is seen. Pathogenesis of tuberculosis:   Infection by M. tuberculosis proceeds in steps, from initial infection of macrophages to a subsequent Th1 response that both contains the bacteria and causes tissue damage.   Early in infection, M. tuberculosis replicates essentially unchecked within macrophages, and later in infection, the cell response stimulates macrophages to contain the proliferation of the bacteria.   The steps for infection are as follows: Entry into macrophag esM. tuberculosis enters macrophages by phagocytosis. Replication in macrophagesM. tuberculosis inhibits the maturation of the phagosome. It blocks the formation of the phagolysosome (Option B), allowing the bacterium to replicate unchecked within the vesicle. Thus, during the earliest stage of primary tuberculosis (<3 weeks) in the nonsensitized individual, bacteria proliferate in the pulmonary alveolar macrophages and air spaces, resulting in bacteremia and seeding of multiple sites. Despite the bacteremia, most people at this stage are asymptomatic or have a mild flu-like illness. Innate immunity (Option C)Mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan binds TLR2, and unmethylated CpG nucleotides bind TLR9. These interactions initiate and enhance the innate and adaptive immune responses to M. tuberculosis, as described below. Th1 response, Th1 mediated macrophage activation, and killing of the bacteria (mediated by IFN- γ). Granulomatous inflammation and damage (mediated by Th1 response) (Option D). Caseous necrosis and giant cell formation (epithelioid histiocytes-giant cells, mediated by IFN- γ)."

Regional lymph node involvement is late. Cavitation occurs readily with the erosion of the cavities into an airway. Histology: Active lesions show coalescent tubercles with central caseation (Caseous necrosis). Disseminated TB: Spread to other organs. The images below show the caseous necrosis seen in TB. Other foci:   Simmond focus: Liver.   Weighert focus: Blood vessels (Statement iv)   Rich’s focus: Brain."

        "solution": "Correct Answer: D) Accumulation of CD4+ T cells and increased CD4/CD8 T-cell ratios Explanation :   Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown cause involving multiple organs.   Sarcoid granulomas exhibit an accumulation of CD4+ T cells, with CD4/CD8 T-cell ratios ranging from 5: 1 to 15: 1.   Several immunologic abnormalities in the local milieu of sarcoid granulomas suggest a cell-mediated immune response to an unidentified antigen.   These abnormalities include: Intra-alveolar and interstitial accumulation of CD4+ T cells, resulting in CD4/CD8 T-cell ratios ranging from 5: 1 to 15: 1, suggesting pathogenic involvement of CD4+ helper T cells. (Option A) There is an oligoclonal expansion of T-cell subsets (Option B) Increased T cell-derived Th1 cytokines such as IL-2 and interferon (IFN)- γ may be responsible for T-cell expansion and macrophage activation, respectively.

        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Lofgren's syndrome Explanation :   This patient's clinical presentation and lab findings are suggestive of Lofgren’s syndrome which is associated with sarcoidosis.   A history of uveitis, elevated levels of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which is a marker of granulomatous activity, and hypercalcemia (increased activation of vitamin D by macrophages within granulomas) all point to systemic involvement and suggest sarcoidosis. Lofgren syndrome triad: Lupus pernio (Option A):   Cutaneous manifestation of sarcoidosis characterised by violaceous or erythematous indurated plaques distributed on the central face, particularly the nose and cheeks. Mikulicz syndrome (Option C):   Defined as diffuse and bilateral enlargement of the salivary and lacrimal glands.   It can occur as an isolated phenomenon or as a part of systemic diseases like sarcoidosis, Sjögren syndrome, etc. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Option D):   Autoimmune disease affecting multiple organs, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and heart.

        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Non-necrotizing granulomas with asteroid bodies and Schaumann bodies Explanation:   Sarcoidosis is characterised by non-necrotizing granulomas containing asteroid bodies (stellate-shaped structures) and Schaumann bodies (calcium and protein inclusions). Asteroid Bodies:   Asteroid bodies are stellate or star-shaped structures seen within the cytoplasm of giant cells.   They are composed of aggregated proteinaceous material consisting primarily of fibrin.   The image below shows asteroid bodies. Schaumann Bodies:   They are concentrically laminated, basophilic structures found within the cytoplasm of giant cells.   They comprise calcium and proteinaceous material, such as mucopolysaccharides and immunoglobulins.   Macrophages with abundant cytoplasm containing dusty brown pigment (smokers’ macrophages) (Option A) are seen in desquamative interstitial pneumonia and respiratory bronchiolitis–associated interstitial lung disease.   Coalescent tubercles with central caseation (Option C) are seen in active lesions of secondary tuberculosis.   Curschmann spirals (extrusion of mucus plugs from subepithelial mucous glands) and Charcot-Leyden crystals (composed of the eosinophil-derived protein) (Option D) are characteristic findings in sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens of patients with atopic asthma."

        "answer": 4,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: D) Psittacosis Explanation:   As the histopathology shows carbon-laden macrophages, it is not associated with Psittacosis which is a zoonotic bacterial infection caused by Chlamydia psittaci, contracted from exposure to infected birds, such as parrots.   Carbon deposits are dark black and are readily visible grossly and microscopically.   Inhaled carbon pigment is engulfed by alveolar or interstitial macrophages, accumulating in the connective tissue adjacent to the lymphatics and organised lymphoid tissue adjacent to the bronchi or lung hilum. Anthracosis (Option A) is the deposition of carbon particles in the lungs due to chronic inhalation of smoke, soot, or pollution.   It is commonly seen in urban dwellers, smokers, and coal workers. HPE shows carbon-laden macrophages. Coal Worker’s Pneumoconiosis (CWP) Simple CWP (Option B)Complicated CWP (Option C) It is characterised by coal macules (1 to 2 mm in diameter) and larger coal nodules containing carbon-laden macrophages and a delicate network of collagen fibres. Although these lesions are scattered throughout the lung, the upper lobes and upper zones of the lower lobes are more heavily involved. Dilatation of alveoli adjacent to bronchioles gives rise to centrilobular emphysema.It leads to progressive massive fibrosis and large, dark scars measuring 1 to 10 cm in diameter, often appearing in multiple areas.

        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Silicosis Explanation:   The chest X-ray shows calcification of hilar lymph nodes, called eggshell calcification.   The clinical picture, along with eggshell calcification, suggests silicosis. Silicosis:   It is the most prevalent occupational lung disease in the world.   Cause: Inhalation of proinflammatory crystalline silicon dioxide (silica).   After decades of exposure, it usually presents as slowly progressing, nodular, fibrosing pneumoconiosis.   Occupations at risk: Foundry work. Sandblasting. Hard rock mining. Stone cutting. Jewellers using chalk moulds.   Foundry work.   Sandblasting.   Hard rock mining.   Stone cutting.   Jewellers using chalk moulds.   Pathogenesis: Phagocytosis of inhaled silica crystals by macrophages activates the inflammasome and stimulates the release of inflammatory mediators, particularly IL-1 and IL-18.

        },
        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Amphibole Explanation:   Amphibole (crocidolite, amosite) is the most toxic form of asbestos.   Asbestos is a family of crystalline hydrated silicates associated with pulmonary fibrosis and various forms of cancer.   It occurs in two distinct geometric forms: serpentine and amphibole.   Amphiboles are straight and stiffly aligned with the airstream and can be delivered deeper into the lungs. They can penetrate epithelial cells and reach the interstitium.   Chrysolites, with their more flexible, curled structure, are likely to become impacted in the upper respiratory passages and removed by the mucociliary elevator. Even if they get trapped in the lungs, they are easily removed as they are more soluble.   Both amphiboles and serpentines are fibrogenic and are associated with a higher incidence of asbestos-related diseases. Serpentine/ Chrysolite Amphibole/ Crocidolite/ Amosite Wavy Rigid More common (90% of the asbestos) More pathogenic (amphiboles particularly associated with mesothelioma) Mnemonic: I am crying (Chrysotile) After looking at a snake (Serpentine) Snake is wavy Snakes can be seen more commonly (more common)Mnemonic: I am on a site (Amosite) Saw a Crocodile (Crocidolite) Which is an Amphibian Crocodile is straight (rigid) Erionite is a naturally occurring fibrous mineral with properties similar to asbestos.

        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Adenocarcinoma Explanation:   The patient's occupational history where he worked as a Shipbuilder suggests that he was chronically exposed to Asbestos and the most common lung malignancy seen with occupational asbestos exposure is adenocarcinoma.   Asbestos exposure is a well-established risk factor for developing laryngeal, ovarian, colon, lung and pleural cancers.   Asbestos-related lung carcinoma is markedly magnified by smoking.   Thus, asbestos workers (particularly those who smoke) are at much higher risk of dying of lung carcinoma than mesothelioma.   Compared to other occupational lung diseases which affect the upper lobes of the lungs, it commonly affects the lower lobes.   Adenocarcinoma (primary bronchogenic carcinoma) is the most common type of cancer that accounts for about 45%, followed by squamous cell carcinoma.

The patient usually complains that the symptoms worsen when they come to work on Monday, hence the name Monday disease. They get better when off work, and symptoms reduce as the week progresses. This cycle is repeated.   Bagassosis is caused by inhaling the fibrous cane-sugar residue called bagasse. It occurs in those working with bagasse, such as those in wallboard or paper manufacturing, but is not seen in sugar industry workers.   Siderosis is due to exposure to iron oxide in welders.   Berylliosis is caused by beryllium exposure. It leads to non-caseating granulomas, as in sarcoidosis and can be differentiated based on industry exposure.   Stannosis- Tin/ Lead exposure.

        "solution": "Correct Option B - Diffuse alveolar damage:   The most common lung finding in a COVID-19 infection is diffuse alveolar damage (DAD).   COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which primarily affects the respiratory system.   When the virus enters the lungs, it can cause inflammation and damage to the alveoli, which are the tiny air sacs responsible for gas exchange.   Diffuse alveolar damage is a histopathological pattern observed in the lungs of patients with severe respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.   It is characterized by injury to the alveolar epithelium, inflammation, and the accumulation of fluid, protein, and inflammatory cells within the alveolar spaces.   This leads to impaired oxygenation and respiratory distress. Incorrect Options: Option A - Pulmonary infarction:   Pulmonary infarction refers to the obstruction of the blood supply to a portion of the lung, resulting in tissue death.   While COVID-19 can cause vascular complications and blood clotting disorders, pulmonary infarction is not the most common lung finding associated with COVID-19.

Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis.   The presence of caseating granulomas, which are central necrotic areas surrounded by a rim of epithelioid cells and Langhans giant cells, is a characteristic histopathological finding in tuberculosis. Incorrect Options: Option B - Leprosy:   Leprosy is caused by Mycobacterium leprae and typically presents with skin lesions, peripheral nerve involvement, and granulomatous inflammation.   The histopathological features of leprosy include granulomas, but with a different pattern compared to tuberculosis. Option C - Sarcoidosis:   Sarcoidosis is a systemic disorder characterized by the formation of non-caseating granulomas, predominantly involving the lungs, lymph nodes, and other organs.   The absence of caseation and the presence of non-caseating granulomas differentiate sarcoidosis from tuberculosis. Option D - Syphilis:   Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum.

        },
        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Hyperplasia of parietal cells within the stomach Explanation: The characteristic features described in the scenario, including recurrent abdominal pain, heartburn, multiple duodenal ulcers, and elevated serum gastrin levels, strongly suggest a diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. A hallmark feature of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is marked hyperplasia of parietal cells within the stomach, leading to increased oxyntic mucosal thickness induced by excessive gastrin secretion from gastrinomas. Presence of gastrin-secreting tumors in the stomach (Option A):   Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is characterized by gastrin-secreting neuroendocrine tumors called gastrinomas.   However, these tumors are predominantly found in the small intestine or pancreas rather than the stomach.   The most common extrapancreatic site of gastrinoma is the duodenum. Presence of erosive esophagitis and hiatal hernia (Option B):   These features are commonly associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), not Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.   ZES primarily presents with duodenal ulcers or chronic diarrhea due to excessive gastric acid secretion from gastrinomas. Association with MEN2 gene mutation (Option D): Gastrinomas are sporadic in 75% of cases. Approximately 25% of patients with gastrinomas have MEN1 (not MEN2), which is linked to aggressive tumor behaviour and primarily presents with duodenal tumors."

CD34 (Option A): CD34 is a cell surface marker often expressed in GISTs. However, CD34 positivity alone cannot confirm GIST diagnosis, especially when C-kit mutation testing is negative. It aids in diagnosis, particularly when used alongside markers like DOG1. S-100(Option C): S100 is a marker commonly associated with neural and melanocytic tumors, not typically expressed in GISTs. CD117(Option D): CD117 (C-kit) expression is a hallmark of GISTs and is used as a most common diagnostic marker, but it does not confirm the diagnosis in the absence of C-kit mutations."

          "D": "BRAF mutation"
        },
        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) KIT mutation Explanation: KIT (c-kit) is a proto-oncogene encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase. Mutations in KIT are the most common genetic abnormalities in GISTs, occurring in about 70-80% of cases. These mutations result in constant activation of KIT signaling, driving tumor growth and survival. PDGFRA mutation (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha) (Option B): PDGFRA is a proto-oncogene that encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase. Mutations in PDGFRA occur in approximately 5-10% of GISTs and, similar to KIT mutations, drive tumor growth and progression by activating downstream signaling pathways. SDH mutation (Succinate Dehydrogenase) (Option C):   SDH is a mitochondrial enzyme complex essential for cellular energy production.   Mutations in genes encoding SDH subunits (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD) are observed in SDH-deficient GISTs, which are also called KIT/PDGFRA wild-types as they lack KIT and PDGFRA mutations.   These types of GIST are seen in cases with Carney-Stratakis syndrome (GIST + paraganglioma) or the Carney triad (GIST + paraganglioma + pulmonary chondroma)."

Paneth cells (Option C):   Paneth cells, located in the small intestine's crypts of Lieberkühn, particularly in the ileum, secrete antimicrobial peptides like defensins and lysozyme to defend against bacterial infections. G cells (Option D):   G cells are endocrine cells in the gastric antrum that produce gastrin, a hormone that stimulates gastric acid secretion.

          "D": "Crohn's disease"
        },
        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Carcinoid tumor Explanation: Based on the patient's presentation and histological findings, the most likely diagnosis is a Carcinoid tumor that originates from scattered neuroendocrine cells in the GIT.   They present with symptoms like flushing, bronchospasm, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and occasionally weight loss due to the secretion of vasoactive substances like serotonin, leading to carcinoid syndrome.   Upper GI endoscopy may reveal yellow-tan intramural or submucosal masses.   Histological examination often reveals cohesive cells with scant granular cytoplasm and stains positive for neuroendocrine markers like chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and leucine-7. Gastric outlet obstruction (Option B):   Gastric outlet obstruction can be caused by conditions like gastric cancer or peptic ulcer disease in adults and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in children.   The obstruction leads to decreased HCl secretion, resulting in metabolic alkalosis.   Paradoxical aciduria may be a compensatory mechanism through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (Option C): Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is a congenital condition characterized by hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the pyloric muscle, leading to gastric outlet obstruction in infants. It presents with non-bilious projectile vomiting, an olive-shaped lump palpable in the abdomen, and failure to thrive. Crohn's disease (Option D):   Crohn's disease is a chronic granulomatous inflammation that affects the entire gastrointestinal tract, characterized by non-caseating granulomas with epithelioid histiocytes, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells.   It also shows intramural masses or strictures with patchy inflammation and \"skip lesions\" observed on endoscopy."

        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) CDH1 gene mutation Explanation: The clinical presentation and biopsy revealing well-differentiated glandular structures with intestinal metaplasia suggest the diagnosis of ‘Intestinal type of gastric cancer’, which has no significant association with CDH-1 gene mutation. Mutations in the CDH1 gene (E-cadherin), associated with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC), can lead to an increased risk of diffuse-type gastric cancer but not related to the intestinal type of gastric cancer. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection (Option A): H. pylori infection is highly associated with intestinal-type gastric cancer as this bacterium causes chronic inflammation and atrophic gastritis, leading to intestinal metaplasia. APC gene mutation(Option B):   The APC gene mutation is primarily associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and colorectal cancer.   In intestinal-type gastric cancer, APC mutations may contribute to dysregulated Wnt signaling pathways, leading to aberrant cell growth and adenoma-carcinoma progression. High intake of smoked or pickled foods (Option D): Diets high in smoked or pickled foods are specifically associated with an increased risk of intestinal-type gastric cancer due to exposure to nitrosamines and other carcinogens present in these food preparations."

Option B) Fundic gland polyps are commonly associated with H. pylori infection: They are primarily associated with conditions such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or mutations in genes like APC or MUTYH. The prevalence of sporadic fundic gland polyps has increased due to the widespread use of PPIs. Option D) Sporadic fundic gland polyps carry a significant risk of neoplasia: Sporadic fundic gland polyps, including those related to PPI therapy, usually have no significant neoplastic risk.

        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Lymphocytic gastritis Explanation:   The clinical presentation, with the characteristic endoscopic appearance of thickened folds, small nodules, and central aphthous ulcerations affecting the entire stomach, suggests Lymphocytic gastritis or Varioliform gastritis.   It is associated with increased intraepithelial T lymphocytes and may be linked to celiac disease. Eosinophilic gastritis (Option A):   Eosinophilic gastritis is characterised by dense infiltrates of eosinophils in the gastric mucosa and muscularis, commonly in the antral or pyloric region.   It is often linked to allergies like cow’s milk or soy protein, particularly in children, and it does not present with the distinctive endoscopic appearance described in the scenario. Granulomatous gastritis (Option C): Granulomatous gastritis contains granulomas and can be caused by various conditions, including Crohn's disease, sarcoidosis, and certain infections. It is not associated with the given endoscopic appearance. Chemical gastritis (Option D): Chemical gastritis, also known as reactive gastropathy, is characterised by mucosal changes resulting from exposure to irritants like NSAIDs, alcohol, or bile reflux.

        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Modified Giemsa stain Explanation: The given clinical presentation suggests peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and the organism involved in this condition is Helicobacter pylori.   Due to its high sensitivity and specificity, the Modified Giemsa stain is widely regarded as the gold standard for H. pylori detection.   It selectively targets H. pylori bacteria, staining them pink to red against a blue or purple background. Option A) Warthin Starry silver stain The Warthin-Starry silver stain is a specialised technique for visualising bacteria like Helicobacter pylori and Spirochetes. However, it is less commonly used than the Modified Giemsa stain for H. pylori due to its more complex procedure and lower sensitivity. Option B) Wright stain The Wright stain is primarily used for staining blood cells and is not routinely employed for identifying H. pylori.

Larger adenomas are most likely to develop into invasive carcinoma   Adenomas larger than 4 cm in diameter have nearly a 40% chance of containing invasive cancer. Villous architecture(Option A): Villous adenomas are associated with a higher incidence of cancer than tubular adenomas, but this correlation primarily arises from their larger size rather than their architectural characteristics alone. Histologic grade of dysplasia(Option C): High-grade dysplasia within an individual polyp increases its risk of harboring cancer. However, histologic grade of dysplasia is not the primary factor correlating with the overall risk of malignancy across adenomas.

All species complete their life cycle in a single host with asexual and sexual phases. Pathophysiology:   As few as 10 oocysts can cause symptomatic infection.   Sporozoites are released in the intestine and attach to the brush border of enterocytes.   Induces changes in the enterocyte cytoskeleton, leading to engulfment.   Causes sodium malabsorption, chloride secretion, and increased tight junction permeability.   Results in non-bloody, watery diarrhea. Histological Findings:   Mucosal histology is often minimally altered.   Persistent infections in children or heavy infections in immunocompromised patients can lead to: Villous atrophy Crypt hyperplasia Inflammatory infiltrates   Villous atrophy   Crypt hyperplasia   Inflammatory infiltrates   Cryptosporidium organisms are seen as small blue spheres that appear to lie on top of the brush border but are actually enveloped by a thin layer of host cell cytoplasm.   Villous atrophy   Crypt hyperplasia   Inflammatory infiltrates The small round blue organisms at the lumenal border are Cryptosporidium   Diagnosis: Based on the detection of oocysts in stool samples. Most organisms are concentrated in the terminal ileum and proximal colon, but can be found throughout the gut and other sites in immunodeficient hosts.

Based on the detection of oocysts in stool samples.   Most organisms are concentrated in the terminal ileum and proximal colon, but can be found throughout the gut and other sites in immunodeficient hosts. Microsporidium (Option B): This is the incorrect option. While Microsporidia can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, they are more commonly associated with immunocompromised patients and do not typically present with oocysts in stool samples. Microsporidia are smaller and often require specialized staining techniques for diagnosis. Giardia lamblia (Option C): Giardia can also cause non-bloody diarrhea and is associated with contaminated water, but the typical presentation may include foul-smelling stools and more pronounced abdominal discomfort. The diagnosis would be based on cysts or trophozoites rather than oocysts. Entamoeba histolytica (Option D): This organism usually causes dysentery with bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain, which does not fit the clinical presentation in this scenario. The diagnosis would be based on the presence of trophozoites or cysts, not oocysts."

        },
        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Option B - B:   B is the acini.   The acini are the functional units of the exocrine pancreas responsible for producing and secreting digestive enzymes into the pancreatic ducts.   In cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, there is a defect in the production or function of the CFTR protein.   This leads to thick, sticky mucus forming in various organs, including the pancreas.   In the pancreas, the defective CFTR protein affects the secretion of chloride ions and water, dehydrating pancreatic secretions.   This thickened mucus obstructs the pancreatic ducts, preventing the proper flow of digestive enzymes from the acini into the duodenum.   Consequently, there is a reduction in the production and release of pancreatic enzymes, leading to impaired digestion and malabsorption of nutrients. Incorrect Options:   Options A, C, and D are not affected by cystic fibrosis. Option A - A:   A is the islets of Langerhans.   The islets of Langerhans are responsible for the production and secretion of hormones such as insulin and glucagon. Option C - C:   C is the intralobular duct.   The intralobular ducts are part of the pancreatic duct system and play a role in transporting pancreatic enzymes. Option D - D:   D is the interlobular duct.   The interlobular ducts transport pancreatic secretions."

          "D": "Obstruction by inflammatory strictures"
        },
        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Option A - Failure of migration of neural crest cells:   Hirschsprung disease, also known as congenital aganglionic megacolon, is a developmental disorder of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses of the distal bowel, leading to functional obstruction.   Hirschsprung disease occurs due to the failure of the migration of neural crest cells, which are responsible for the development of the enteric nervous system.   In normal development, neural crest cells migrate along the gastrointestinal tract and populate the entire length, including the distal bowel.   In Hirschsprung disease, there is a segment of the bowel where the ganglion cells fail to migrate, resulting in an aganglionic segment leading to functional obstruction and impaired motility. Incorrect Options: Option B - Increase ganglion cells:   Hirschsprung disease is characterized by a lack of ganglion cells. Option C - Visceral myopathy:   Visceral myopathy refers to a group of disorders characterized by abnormal smooth muscle function in the gastrointestinal tract.   While Hirschsprung disease involves abnormalities in the enteric nervous system, it does not involve primary defects in the smooth muscle layer. Option D - Obstruction by inflammatory strictures:   Inflammatory strictures are not associated with the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease."

        },
        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Transferrin saturation Explanation:   The diagnosis in this case is hemochromatosis.   Transferrin saturation (TSAT) is the best screening test for hereditary hemochromatosis.   TSAT measures the amount of iron bound to transferrin, reflecting the body's iron status.   Elevated TSAT levels (>45-50%) suggest iron overload, which is a characteristic feature of hemochromatosis. Serum ferritin is a protein that stores iron in the body. However, while serum ferritin levels can be a useful indicator, they are not as specific as transferrin saturation (TSAT) for diagnosing hemochromatosis (Option A). In hereditary hemochromatosis, LFTs may show abnormalities in advanced stages of the disease when iron overload has caused liver damage (e.g., elevated alanine transaminase or AST levels). However, LFTs are not specific screening tests for hemochromatosis (Option C). Genetic testing for mutations in the HFE gene is the definitive diagnostic test for hereditary hemochromatosis (Option D)."

        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Kayser-Fleischer rings Explanation: The image shows characteristic Kayser-Fleischer rings, a brownish-green discolouration in the cornea.   These rings are associated with Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder involving copper metabolism.   Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder characterised by impaired copper metabolism. It leads to copper accumulation primarily in the liver, brain, and other organs.   Molecular genetic testing can identify mutations in the ATP7B gene, which is responsible for Wilson's disease. Clinical Features:   Kayser-Fleischer Rings: These are characteristic brownish-green rings seen in the cornea due to copper deposition and are a hallmark feature of Wilson's disease.   Serum copper is raised, while ceruloplasmin levels (a copper-binding protein) are decreased in Wilson's disease.   Increased urinary copper excretion is a characteristic finding in Wilson's disease. Arcus senilis refers to a white or greyish ring around the cornea that is commonly seen in elderly individuals. It is caused by lipid deposits in the peripheral cornea and is generally considered a normal age-related change. (Option A) Roth spots are retinal haemorrhages with a white or pale centre.

          "D": "Dark areas represent peri-portal hepatocytes"
        },
        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Option A - Dark areas represent necrosis, white areas represent viable liver:   Cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease characterized by fibrosis and nodular regeneration of the liver parenchyma.   It results from various causes, such as chronic alcohol abuse, viral hepatitis, or metabolic disorders.   In cirrhosis, the liver undergoes extensive remodeling, leading to the destruction of normal liver architecture and the formation of fibrous bands.   The dark areas in the liver represent areas of necrosis.   Necrosis refers to the death of liver cells due to insufficient blood supply or impaired liver function.   These areas may appear darker due to the loss of cellular integrity and blood congestion.   The white areas in the liver represent viable liver tissue.   These areas contain functional hepatocytes that are responsible for normal liver functions such as detoxification, metabolism, and the synthesis of proteins.   The presence of viable liver tissue is essential for overall liver function, despite the structural abnormalities caused by cirrhosis. Incorrect Options:   Options B, C, and D are incorrect.

        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Option B - Carcinoma of body pancreas often present with jaundice:   Carcinomas of the body and tail of the pancreas often do not present with jaundice because they are not located near the common bile duct.   Jaundice is more commonly associated with tumors located in the head of the pancreas, where they can obstruct the common bile duct and lead to the accumulation of bilirubin in the bloodstream.   In contrast, tumors in the body of the pancreas may cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, weight loss, and digestive issues but are less likely to cause jaundice. Incorrect Options: Option A - Cigarette smoking is a risk factor:   Cigarette smoking is a well-established risk factor for pancreatic carcinoma.   It is one of the most significant environmental risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer, increasing the likelihood of developing the disease. Option C - They elicit intense desmoplastic response:   Pancreatic carcinoma is known for its intense desmoplastic response.   The tumor microenvironment in pancreatic cancer is characterized by the proliferation of fibrous connective tissue, which creates a dense stromal reaction around the tumor cells.   This desmoplastic response contributes to the poor prognosis and therapeutic challenges associated with pancreatic carcinoma. Option D - Perineural invasion is common:   Perineural invasion is a common feature of pancreatic carcinoma.   The tumor cells have a propensity to invade and infiltrate along the nerves in the vicinity of the pancreas, which can contribute to the spread and metastasis of the disease."

        "solution": "Correct Answer: D) Armani-Ebstein lesion Explanation: In uncontrolled diabetes, glucosuria causes glycogen accumulation in the proximal tubular cells (not in the glomerulus), known as Armanni-Ebstein cells. This pathological finding is more commonly associated with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) than with diabetic nephropathy. Incorrect options explanation Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodule (Option A) Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules (aka Nodular glomerulosclerosis) are a hallmark of diabetic nephropathy. They are ovoid or spherical, PAS-positive nodules found in the mesangial core of glomeruli. They are often accompanied by mesangiolysis and sometimes surrounded by dilated capillary loops. Diffuse glomerulosclerosis (Option B) Diffuse glomerulosclerosis refers to a diffuse increase in the mesangial matrix and thickening of GBM. It correlates with deteriorating renal function and increasing proteinuria.   This is the most common histopathological finding of diabetic nephropathy. Arteriolar hyalinosis (Option C)   Arteriolar hyalinosis involves the accumulation of hyaline material in the walls of both afferent and efferent arterioles, contributing to ischemia and kidney damage in diabetes.   Hyaline material accumulated in capillary loops is known as “fibrin caps” in Bowman’s capsule, it is called “capsular drops.”"

        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) NPHS2 Explanation: The above clinical scenario points towards the diagnosis of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, which is defined as the absence of remission despite 4 weeks of therapy with daily prednisone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/d.   Mutations in the NPHS2 gene lead to this syndrome, typically manifesting in childhood.   The NPHS2 gene is located on chromosome 1q25–q31.   The NPHS2 gene encodes the protein product known as podocin which is localised to the slit diaphragm within the kidney.   Patients typically present from birth to 6 years of age have a steroid-resistant course and reach End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD) before the end of their first decade. NPHS1 (Option A) NPHS1 mutations are associated with congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type. α-actinin 4 (Option C) Mutations in the gene encoding the podocyte actin-binding protein α-actinin 4 (ACTN4) underlie some cases of autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which tends to have a high rate of progression to renal insufficiency. TRPC6 (Option D) Mutations in the TRPC6 gene, which encodes a calcium-permeable ion channel in podocytes, have been identified in some cases of familial FSGS.

        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Good response to corticosteroid therapy Explanation:   The clinical and electron microscope findings suggest the diagnosis as Minimal Change Disease (MCD), characterised by diffuse effacement of foot processes of podocytes in glomeruli. It primarily affects children aged 2-6 years.   MCD typically responds rapidly to corticosteroid therapy, especially in children (>90%), leading to complete remission of proteinuria and resolution of symptoms. Lipid deposition within glomerular capillaries (Option A) Lipid deposition within glomerular capillaries is not observed in MCD. Instead, protein and lipid deposition may occur in the proximal tubules due to tubular reabsorption of lipoproteins passing through diseased glomeruli, leading to the historical term \"lipoid nephrosis\" for this disease. Immunofluorescence microscopy reveals granular deposition of IgG and C3 in the glomeruli (Option B)   Immunofluorescence studies in MCD typically show no significant immune complex deposition or granular staining patterns.   This distinguishes MCD from immune complex-mediated glomerular diseases like IgA nephropathy or lupus nephritis, where IgG and C3 deposits are commonly observed. Non-selective proteinuria (Option D) Minimal Change Disease (MCD) typically presents with highly selective proteinuria, mostly albumin.

        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Renal oncocytoma Explanation: Renal Oncocytoma:   It is most commonly seen in > 50-year-old adults.   It arises from the intercalated cells of the collecting ducts.   Gross appearance:Tan or mahogany brown, with a central scar.   Microscopy: Composed of pink eosinophilic cells with small, round, benign-appearing nuclei.   Electron microscope: Numerous mitochondria (granular appearance) Epithelioid angiomyolipoma (Option B) is a rare variant of angiomyolipoma composed of smooth muscle cells, fat, and blood vessels, and it often occurs in patients with tuberous sclerosis. However, the gross appearance of the specimen, without fat and showing a well-circumscribed mass, is more consistent with renal oncocytoma. Clear cell carcinoma (Option C) would typically present with more aggressive features like hematuria, anemia, and vascular invasion. This patient's presentation along with a well-circumscribed mass is more typical of a benign tumor. Urothelial carcinoma (Option D) is unlikely because the mass is located in the renal parenchyma, and in urothelial carcinoma it is typically found in the renal pelvis or ureter, often with associated hematuria."

        "solution": "Correct Option B - Anti-GBM antibodies:   Crescents on renal biopsy indicate glomerular involvement and suggest the possibility of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN).   The most relevant test to perform is the detection of anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies.   Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies are specific markers for Goodpasture syndrome, a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of autoantibodies targeting the glomerular basement membrane and lung alveolar basement membrane. Incorrect Options: Option A - ANA:   Antinuclear antibodies are associated with systemic autoimmune conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus.   While SLE can involve the kidneys and cause glomerulonephritis, it is not the most likely cause, and the presence of crescents suggests a more acute and rapidly progressive disease. Option C - HIV RNA:   Human immunodeficiency virus infection can cause renal complications, including HIV-associated nephropathy.   The patient's presentation of hematuria, pedal edema, and the presence of crescents on renal biopsy make Goodpasture syndrome a more likely diagnosis than HIV-associated nephropathy.

        "solution": "Correct answer: C) It is very commonly associated with a well-defined hormonal disorder. Explanation: Cryptorchidism:   It is a complete or partial failure of the intra-abdominal testes to descend into the scrotal sac, associated with testicular dysfunction and an increased risk of testicular cancer.   It usually occurs as an isolated anomaly but may be accompanied by other genitourinary tract malformations, such as hypospadias. (Option A)   The normal descent of the testes occurs in two phases: Transabdominal phase: Mediated by Mullerian inhibiting substance. Inguinoscrotal phase: Mediated by the androgen-induced release of calcitonin-related gene peptide.   Transabdominal phase: Mediated by Mullerian inhibiting substance.   Inguinoscrotal phase: Mediated by the androgen-induced release of calcitonin-related gene peptide.   Sites of arrest of descent: Inguinal canal (most common). (Option B) Abdomen (uncommon).   Inguinal canal (most common). (Option B)   Abdomen (uncommon).   Morphology: Gross: The testis is small, brown, and atrophic. Microscopic: Atrophic tubules with thickened basement membrane.

        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) HPV 6 and 11. Explanation: Histopathology image suggests Condylomata acuminata, which are benign genital warts caused by low-risk HPV 6 and 11, a double-stranded DNA virus that infects differentiated squamous epithelial cells.   It is sexually transmitted and is characterized by multiple, raised, fleshy skin-coloured growths and involves vulvar, vagina, perineal, and perianal regions.   Condyloma acuminata are cauliflower-like, dry, and bulky, typically found in the squamous mucosa of the anal canal.   Condyloma lata are smooth, moist, and flat, often located in the genital area, inner thighs, axillae, or oral mucosa.   Unlike condyloma acuminata, condyloma lata may appear ulcerated.   Microscopic examination reveals papillary, exophytic, treelike stromal cores covered by thickened squamous epithelium.   Koilocytes are evident, featuring enlarged nuclei, hyperchromasia, and a perinuclear cytoplasmic halo.   These are not precancerous lesions, and HPV vaccines provide excellent protection. HPV 16 and 18 (Option B): HPV 16 and 18 are high-risk strains responsible for cervical carcinoma, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and vulvar carcinoma."

        "answer": 4,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: D) Regurgitation theory Explanation: The clinical presentation and presence of a chocolate brown cyst on the ovaries suggest Endometriosis. This condition often occurs due to retrograde menstruation through the fallopian tubes, which frequently occurs, leading to the implantation of endometrial tissue at ectopic sites due to the backward flow of menstrual endometrium. The regurgitation theory (Sampson’s theory) explains the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue in the peritoneal cavity, which is present in most cases; thus, it is widely accepted. Benign metastasis theory (Halban’s theory) (Option A) The benign metastasis theory suggests that endometrial tissue from the uterus can disseminate to distant locations, such as the bone, lungs, and brain, through blood vessels and lymphatic channels. Metaplastic theory (Meyer and Ivanoff’s theory) (Option B) The metaplastic theory suggests that endometrial tissue can develop directly from the coelomic epithelium, which is the embryonic origin of the Mullerian ducts and the endometrium. Extrauterine stem/progenitor cell theory (Option C) The Extrauterine stem/progenitor cell theory suggests that progenitor cells from the bone marrow differentiate into endometrial tissue."

        },
        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Fat Necrosis Explanation: The most likely diagnosis in this patient with recent trauma and calcification could be fat necrosis.   Breast fat necrosis is caused by injured or ischemic breast tissue that is replaced with scar tissue and presents as a palpable nodule.   It is commonly caused by breast trauma and breast surgical procedures.   It presents as a mammographic density, a painless palpable lump, skin thickening, or deposits of calcium.   Fat necrosis can manifest in a variety of ways that closely resemble cancer like irregular breast mass, usually fixed to the dermis, with possible skin tethering and/or nipple retraction as a result of fibrotic bands between necrotic tissue and skin.   Calcifications can sometimes occur in fat necrosis, particularly in older lesions. These are typically punctate (tiny dots) and scattered throughout the lump, unlike some cancers (differentiated by biopsy). Mastitis(Option A): This is an infection of breast tissue, often caused by bacteria entering through milk ducts during breastfeeding. It can cause inflammation, redness, pain, fever, and chills, which are absent in this case. Breast Abscess(Option B) This is a localized collection of pus within the breast tissue, often caused by a bacterial infection. It presents with fever, chills, and a more fluctuant (fluid-filled) mass compared to the firm mass often felt with fat necrosis. Inflammatory Breast Cancer(Option D): It typically presents with additional symptoms like skin thickening, peau d'orange (skin resembling an orange peel), and rapid progression."

Zuska’s disease is also known as Squamous metaplasia of lactiferous ducts(SMOLD), recurrent subareolar abscess, or periductal mastitis.   The risk factors include a deficiency of vitamin A associated with smoking(90% of cases).   This leads to keratinizing squamous metaplasia of the ductal epithelium, which is cuboidal.   Keratin released from these cells blocks the ductal system.   This leads to the formation of subareolar abscess, dilation, and eventually, the rupture of the duct, causing fistulas."

        "solution": "Correct Answer: D) These lesions are always benign. Explanation: The clinical features and HPE showing increased stromal cellularity and overgrowth, giving rise to the typical leaf-like architecture, suggests phyllodes tumor. The incorrect statement is that these lesions are always benign.   Phyllodes tumors also called cystosarcoma phyllodes are stromal tumors developing from the connective tissue of the breast.   It occurs in middle-aged women (40-50y).   Most phyllodes tumors are benign (noncancerous), but a small number (about 10% to 15%) can be borderline or malignant (cancerous).   They present as a lump in the breast. The lump may be firm, smooth, and well-defined. It may also grow quickly from a few centimeters to massive lesions involving the entire breast.   HPE shows increased stromal cellularity and overgrowth, giving rise to the typical leaf-like architecture.   Phyllodes tumor is differentiated from fibroadenoma based on its overgrowth of stroma, increased mitotic activity and cellularity, and nuclear pleomorphism.   Treatment: Wide local excision (WLE) with a 2-cm margin along with the overlying skin and underlying pectoralis major muscle.

Alzheimer's Disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly.   It affects the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes (Statement 4).   It occurs due to the mutation of the APP gene on Chromosome 21 (Statement 1). If APP is processed by alpha and gamma-secretase pathways, products are soluble and do not deposit in the brain, and there is no disease. (Statement 2). If the beta-secretase pathway processes APP, it produces amyloid products, which are pathogenic.   If APP is processed by alpha and gamma-secretase pathways, products are soluble and do not deposit in the brain, and there is no disease. (Statement 2).

Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is a neuroendocrine tumour arising from parafollicular C cells.   They secrete calcitonin, which regulates calcium levels and is also a marker for diagnosis and postoperative follow-up. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a marker in which calcitonin is negative.   They can be sporadic or associated with familial syndromes like MEN 2.   Both have associated RET mutations.   Sporadic tumours usually present with solitary nodules whereas familial ones are characterised by bilaterality and multicentricity, and can have features of other associated tumours.   A biopsy would show amyloid deposits (Acal) derived from calcitonin polypeptides. A-β (Option A): It is associated with Alzheimer's disease. A-L (Option C): Is associated with primary amyloidosis and multiple myeloma, derived from immunoglobulin light chains. A-TTR (Option D): It is associated with transthyretin and is seen in conditions like familial amyloid polyneuropathy and senile systemic amyloidosis."

          "D": "1, 2 & 4 are correct"
        },
        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct option B: 1 & 2 are correct: 1. Decrease in reduced glutathione:   Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency leads to a decrease in the production of NADPH, which is required for the regeneration of reduced glutathione (GSH).   GSH is an important antioxidant that helps protect cells from oxidative damage.   In G6PD deficiency, the decreased NADPH levels result in reduced regeneration of GSH, leading to a decrease in its concentration.   This reduction in reduced glutathione makes the cells more susceptible to oxidative stress. 2. Decrease in NADPH:   G6PD deficiency results in a decrease in the production of NADPH, as G6PD is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, which generates NADPH.   NADPH is essential for various cellular functions, including maintaining the reduced state of glutathione and providing reducing equivalents for biosynthetic reactions and detoxification processes.   The decreased levels of NADPH in G6PD deficiency can disrupt these cellular processes, leading to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress and impaired cellular function. Incorrect option: Options A, C, and D are incorrect. 3. Decreased lipid peroxidation:   G6PD deficiency does not directly cause a decrease in lipid peroxidation.   In fact, G6PD deficiency can result in increased susceptibility to oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.   The decreased levels of NADPH and reduced glutathione can compromise the cell's antioxidant defense system, leading to increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage. 4. Decreased RBC membrane damage:   G6PD deficiency does not lead to a decrease in RBC membrane damage.   In fact, G6PD-deficient red blood cells (RBCs) are more susceptible to oxidative stress and hemolysis.   The deficiency impairs the ability of RBCs to regenerate reduced glutathione and counteract oxidative damage, making them more vulnerable to hemolysis and membrane damage in the presence of oxidative stressors."

        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Option B - PIT1:   The patient's presentation with long hands and feet and a protruding lower jaw (prognathism) is suggestive of acromegaly.   Acromegaly is most commonly caused by a growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, which leads to excessive secretion of growth hormone (GH).   The gene most commonly implicated in this condition is the PIT1 gene.   The PIT1 gene (also known as POU1F1) encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development and function of the anterior pituitary gland.

        },
        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Option C - Autoimmunity:   The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis starts with an antigenic exposure in an individual who is genetically predisposed, causing activation of CD4+ T-cells, thus releasing cytokines like TNF, IL-1,6, and interferon, which in turn activate endothelial cells, B lymphocytes, and macrophages.   Activation of B lymphocytes results in the release of IgM antibodies against IgG (rheumatoid factor).   This immune complex triggers inflammatory damage to the blood vessels, synovium, and collagen. Further activation of macrophages releases more cytokines that damage the joints and the blood vessels of cartilages, termed pannus formation.   As a result of the destruction of bone and cartilage, fibrosis takes place, which produces visible joint deformities. Incorrect Options:   Options A, B, and D are incorrect."

Giant cell tumour (Osteoclastoma):   It is a benign but locally aggressive tumour characterised by numerous multinucleated osteoclast-type giant cells.   It occurs in the third to fifth decades of life.   Pathogenesis: The neoplastic cells are primitive osteoblast precursors that express high levels of RANKL, promoting the proliferation of osteoclast precursors and their differentiation into mature osteoclasts. This increased activity of osteoclasts is responsible for the tumour being highly lytic and expansile due to uncontrolled bone resorption.

Anaemia decreases RBCs, potentially inflating the reticulocyte percentage without increased erythropoiesis.   The correction adjusts the reticulocyte percentage relative to the reduced RBC count, providing a more accurate assessment of bone marrow response.   An increased corrected reticulocyte count indicates effective erythropoiesis.   Low reticulocyte production may suggest bone marrow issues, iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiencies."

        },
        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) New Methylene blue Explanation: The presence of anaemia typically triggers the body's response by increasing erythropoiesis, releasing reticulocytes into circulation early as part of the compensatory mechanism to replenish red blood cells and enhance tissue oxygenation.   New Methylene blue is used to visualise reticulocytes in peripheral blood smears.   It is a supravital stain that stains living states like the RNA in reticulocytes.   It picks up RNA as a bluish reticulated network within erythrocytes.   This stain is useful in assessing bone marrow function and erythropoietic activity. Prussian blue (Option A): Prussian blue stain detects iron in hemosiderin-containing cells. Iron is chemically reactive and turns blue-black when exposed to potassium ferrocyanide, which is present in Prussian blue. PAS Stain (Option C): A periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain detects polysaccharides, such as glycogen, glycoproteins, glycolipids, and mucin in tissues. Wright's stain (Option D): Wright’s stain is a mixture of eosin (red) and methylene blue dyes. It is used in blood smears and bone marrow aspirates to detect RBCs, WBCs, and Platelets abnormalities."

        },
        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Reticulocytes Explanation: Reticulocytes are smaller pyknotic cells with increased haemoglobin content and have no nucleus.   Increased RBC production occurs as a compensatory mechanism in anaemia, initiating erythropoiesis, which is stimulated by the release of erythropoietin from the kidneys.   Erythropoietin prompts bone marrow to increase red blood cell production by promoting the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into erythroid progenitor cells, ultimately leading to the maturation of red blood cells. Stages of Erythropoiesis   It starts with Hematopoietic stem cells(HSC)→Common Myeloid Progenitor cells(CMP) →Proerythroblasts.   Once the proerythroblast has been formed, it divides multiple times, eventually forming many mature RBCs. Proerythroblast- first cell in which Hb is visualised on Electron microscopy.   Intermediate normoblast- first cell in which Hb is visualised on Light microscopy.   The first-generation cells are called basophil erythroblasts because they stain with basic dyes. Haemoglobin first appears in polychromatophilic erythroblasts and progressively increases.   As erythropoiesis progresses, the cell and nucleus size progressively decreases.   The reticulocyte is the first cell without a nucleus. During the reticulocyte stage, the cells pass from the bone marrow into the blood capillaries by diapedesis (squeezing through the pores of the capillary membrane).   factors affecting erythropoiesis increasing- EPO, Growth hormone, T3, Cortisol, Testosterone decreasing- estrogen   increasing- EPO, Growth hormone, T3, Cortisol, Testosterone   decreasing- estrogen   increasing- EPO, Growth hormone, T3, Cortisol, Testosterone   decreasing- estrogen"

The marrow in CML is hypercellular due to increased numbers of maturing granulocytic precursors (promyelocytes, myelocytes, eosinophils and basophils). A characteristic finding is the presence of scattered macrophages with abundant wrinkled, green-blue cytoplasm (sea-blue histiocytes).

Intravascular hemolysis is caused by mechanical injury, complement fixation, intracellular parasites, or exogenous toxins.   Extravascular hemolysis is due to changes that make red cells less deformable. This makes their passage difficult, leading to red cell sequestration and phagocytosis by macrophages located within the splenic cords. Splenomegaly and jaundice are prominent features.

        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) In HS patients, high osmotic fragility leads to a right shift on the graph. Explanation: The correct statement regarding the osmotic fragility test is high osmotic fragility leads to a right shift on the graph in patients with HS. Osmotic Fragility Test:   Assesses RBC susceptibility to hemolysis in hypotonic saline.   Used for screening HS and thalassemia.   RBCs are incubated in hypotonic saline of varying osmolarities.   Measures hemolysis as saline enters RBCs, causing swelling and lysis. Normal RBC Response:   It begins to lyse around 0.5% NaCl concentration. (Option D)   Maintain shape due to balance between membrane integrity and osmotic pressure. Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS):   RBCs are more fragile due to reduced surface-to-volume ratio.   The osmotic fragility curve shifts to the right.   More susceptible to hemolysis at higher saline concentrations. Thalassemia:   Characterized by smaller and more rigid RBCs.   The osmotic fragility curve shifts to the left. (Option B)   Lyses at lower saline concentrations compared to normal RBCs.

        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Deficiency in an enzyme leads to oxidative stress-induced hemolysis. Explanation: The clinical scenario is suggestive of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency that leads to oxidative stress-induced hemolysis   Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder characterised by a deficiency in the G6PD enzyme, which protects red blood cells from oxidative damage.   This reduces the ability to generate NADPH via the pentose phosphate pathway and impairs glutathione regeneration, exacerbating oxidative stress and hemolysis.(Option B)   When exposed to oxidative stressors, there is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants that neutralize them.   This leads to oxidative damage to red blood cell membranes and proteins, resulting in hemolysis.(Option C)   It presents with episodes of acute hemolytic anemia triggered by oxidative stressors such as infections, certain medications (e.g., antimalarials, sulfonamides), or ingestion of certain foods (e.g., fava beans).(Option D)   Clinical manifestations include fatigue, pallor, jaundice, and dark urine (due to hemoglobinuria).   The severity of hemolysis varies depending on the degree of enzyme deficiency and the magnitude of the oxidative insult, with some individuals experiencing life-threatening hemolytic crises.

        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) It evaluates the ability of red blood cells to reduce methemoglobin back to hemoglobin. Explanation: Purpose of Methemoglobin Reduction Test:   Used to detect glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.   Measures the ability of red blood cells to convert methemoglobin back to hemoglobin.   Helps assess the enzymatic activity crucial for protecting cells from oxidative stress. Mechanism in G6PD Deficiency:   Individuals with G6PD deficiency have reduced enzyme activity.   Red blood cells are more vulnerable to oxidative damage.   Impaired reduction of methemoglobin indicates decreased G6PD function. Testing Procedure:   The blood sample is exposed to a chemical that induces methemoglobin formation.   The rate of reduction back to hemoglobin is measured.   The slower reduction compared to normal suggests G6PD deficiency. Clinical Application:   Used to confirm diagnosis in patients suspected of having G6PD deficiency.   Helps guide management decisions in conditions where oxidative stress can trigger hemolysis.   Provides insight into the enzymatic function critical for maintaining red blood cell integrity. Other tests used for screening include: Fluorescent Spot Test (FST): This is a quick screening test that detects G6PD activity by measuring the rate of reduction of a fluorescent dye. (Option C)   NADPH is autofluorescent   In normal cases: fluorescence is seen.   In G6PD deficiency: Fluorescence not seen Quantitative Enzyme Assays: These tests measure the actual activity levels of G6PD enzyme in the blood.

        "answer": 4,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: D) PIGA gene Explanation: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is due to a mutation in the PIGA gene. Pathogenesis of PNH:   PNH is caused by an acquired mutation in the PIGA gene leading to defective synthesis of (GPI) anchors.   GPI anchors are essential for attaching certain proteins to the cell surface, including CD55 (decay-accelerating factor), CD59 (membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis), and C8-binding protein. (Option B)   These proteins regulate the complement system and inhibit the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) that leads to cell lysis.   In PNH, the deficiency of these regulators increases susceptibility to complement-mediated hemolysis.

Heterozygous patients (HbAS) are said to have sickle cell trait where about 40% of the hemoglobin is HbS and the rest is HbA, which interferes with HbS polymerization.   Therefore they have less severe disease than their homozygous counterparts who have more HbS.   HbF inhibits HbS polymerization more effectively than HbA, keeping infants with sickle cell disease asymptomatic until 5-6 months when HbF levels decline.   Metabolically active intracellular parasites consume oxygen and decrease intracellular pH, promoting sickling of HbAS red cells, which are then rapidly cleared by splenic and hepatic phagocytes, reducing parasite loads.

A thalassemia is a group of inherited blood disorders characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production, leading to anemia.   Genetic defects in thalassemia involve mutations, insertions, or deletions in the genes responsible for producing hemoglobin chains   This results in either decreased or absent production of alpha or beta-globin chains.   These defects are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning an individual must inherit mutated alleles from both parents to manifest the disorder.   There are two main types: alpha-thalassemia and beta-thalassemia. 1. Alpha-thalassemia: Resulting from deletions or mutations in the alpha-globin genes located on chromosome 16. 2. Beta-thalassemia: Arising from mutations in the beta-globin gene located on chromosome 11. Subtypes include:   Beta-thalassemia minor (trait): Reduced beta-globin chain production due to mutations in one allele of the HBB gene.   Beta-thalassemia major: Mutations in both alleles of the HBB gene, leading to severe anemia requiring lifelong transfusions and treatment.   Thalassemia intermedia: Milder variants and unusual forms of β-thalassemia, also include alpha globin defects in some cases. But the cases does not require regular blood transfusions"

        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Splicing mutation resulting in the removal of intervening sequence-IVS1-5 G-> C in the HBB gene. Explanation: Among the given options, Splicing mutation resulting in the removal of intervening sequence-IVS1-5 G-> C in the HBB gene leads to β-thalassemia: This mutation affects the splicing process by altering the consensus splice site, leading to aberrant splicing and abnormal mRNA transcripts, contributing to β-thalassemia.   Beta-thalassemia mutations are diverse and can occur throughout the HBB gene, which encodes the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin.   These mutations can affect various aspects of beta-globin production, including transcription, splicing, mRNA stability, and translation.   Common types of mutations include point mutations, small insertions or deletions, large deletions, and rearrangements within the HBB gene.   These mutations disrupt normal hemoglobin synthesis, leading to reduced or absent beta-globin production and the characteristic clinical features of beta-thalassemia. 3-types of beta thalassemia: FEATURE THALASSEMIA MAJOR THALASSEMIA INTERMEDIATHALASSEMIA MINOR Beta chain production No beta chain production.Little chains present.One beta chain is normal.

        },
        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) RDW is typically elevated in IDA compared to beta-thalassemia minor Explanation: RDW is significantly higher in patients with IDA compared to those with beta-thalassemia minor or coexistent IDA and beta-thalassemia traits.   This is because in IDA, the erythropoiesis process is disrupted, leading to a more varied size of red blood cells and thus an increased RDW.   In contrast, RDW tends to be lower in beta-thalassemia minor as most cells are just microcytic and hypochromic due to uniformly reduced hemoglobin synthesis.   The Mentzer index, which is the MCV divided by the RBC count, is more useful in distinguishing between IDA and beta-thalassemia minor, with a lower Mentzer index (<13) indicating beta-thalassemia minor.   Therefore, an elevated RDW favors a diagnosis of IDA over beta-thalassemia minor in this patient with microcytic, hypochromic anemia.   Confirmatory testing with hemoglobin electrophoresis to detect elevated HbA2 levels (>3.5%) is required to diagnose beta-thalassemia minor.

        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) A black line visible only in the test tube containing blood sample mixed with a 0.36 buffered solution is suggestive of a positive Nestrof test. Explanation: The Nestrof test, also known as the Naked Eye Single Tube Red Cell Osmotic Fragility Test, is a screening test used to identify carriers of beta thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. The test is based on the principle that red blood cells (RBCs) from individuals with beta thalassemia are resistant to hemolysis in hypotonic solutions compared to normal RBCs. Procedure:   Bloood sample is mixed with 0.36% saline solution   After incubation, observe the test tube against a black line.   Look for the presence or absence of a black line behind the tube. Interpretation:   Positive Test: Black line visible in only test tubes A positive NESTROFT indicates that all red cells in the tested sample have not undergone lysis in 0.36% buffered saline. These unlysed red cells result in the hazy appearance of the contents of the tube and render the line on the paper indistinct. Thus a positive NESTROFT indicates decreased red cell osmotic fragility and increased resistance to osmotic lysis.   Black line visible in only test tubes   A positive NESTROFT indicates that all red cells in the tested sample have not undergone lysis in 0.36% buffered saline. These unlysed red cells result in the hazy appearance of the contents of the tube and render the line on the paper indistinct. Thus a positive NESTROFT indicates decreased red cell osmotic fragility and increased resistance to osmotic lysis.   Negative Test (Normal Result): No black line visible in any of the test tubes This indicates that the RBCs have remained intact in control as well as test tube.   No black line visible in any of the test tubes   This indicates that the RBCs have remained intact in control as well as test tube.

        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) C, D, and F Explanation:   Sickle cell disease is a hemoglobinopathy caused by a missense point mutation in the 6th position of the β-globin chain   This replaces the amino acid glutamine with valine which promotes the polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin.   Heterozygous patients (HbAS) are said to have sickle cell trait where about 40% of the hemoglobin is HbS and the rest is HbA, which interferes with HbS polymerization.   Therefore they have less severe disease than their homozygous counterparts who have more HbS.   HbF inhibits HbS polymerization more effectively than HbA, keeping infants with sickle cell disease asymptomatic until 5-6 months when HbF levels decline.   Metabolically active intracellular parasites consume oxygen and decrease intracellular pH, promoting sickling of HbAS red cells, which are then rapidly cleared by splenic and hepatic phagocytes, reducing parasite loads.   In individuals with coexistent α-thalassemia, reduced Hb synthesis results in milder disease."

        "solution": "Basophilic stippling is a characteristic finding seen in lead poisoning.   The retained rRNA appears as small blue granules on a stained peripheral blood smear, leading to the characteristic basophilic stippling seen on blood smears.   The accumulation of ribosomal RNA in lead poisoning is a consequence of disrupted heme synthesis, leading to ineffective red blood cell maturation and the retention of rRNA in developing erythrocytes. Basophilic stippling is a characteristic finding seen in lead poisoning. The retained rRNA appears as small blue granules on a stained peripheral blood smear, leading to the characteristic basophilic stippling seen on blood smears. The accumulation of ribosomal RNA in lead poisoning is a consequence of disrupted heme synthesis, leading to ineffective red blood cell maturation and the retention of rRNA in developing erythrocytes. Schistocytes (Option A): These fragmented red blood cells are typically seen in microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia caused by conditions such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), not in lead poisoning. Spherocytes (Option B): These are round cells with no central pallor, associated with hereditary spherocytosis Bite cells (Option D): Bite cells are seen in G6PD deficiency. In G6PD deficiency, oxidative stress leads to the denaturation of haemoglobin, resulting in the formation of Heinz bodies (aggregates of denatured haemoglobin). Macrophages in the spleen recognize and remove these Heinz bodies, creating a characteristic bite-shaped appearance."

Explanation: In iron deficiency anemia, ferritin translation is decreased by binding iron regulatory protein to iron response elements. Iron regulatory mechanism:   IRP: Binds to IREs in specific mRNAs' untranslated regions (UTRs) to control the translation of proteins involved in iron metabolism.   IRE: These are sequences found in the mRNAs of proteins involved in iron metabolism, such as ferritin and transferrin receptor 1   Ferritin: Ferritin stores iron inside cells. When iron levels are low, IRPs bind to IREs in the 5' UTR of ferritin mRNA, preventing its translation to conserve iron.   Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1): TfR1 imports iron into cells. When iron levels are low, IRPs bind to IREs in the 3' UTR of TfR1 mRNA, stabilizing it and increasing its translation to enhance iron uptake."

        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) DMT-1 Explanation: DMT-1 is a transmembrane protein that facilitates the transport of divalent metal ions, primarily ferrous iron (Fe2+), across the apical membrane of enterocytes in the duodenum.   Heme iron enters the intestinal cells directly through a heme transporter.   Non-heme iron (Fe³■) is first reduced to Fe²■ by duodenal cytochrome B, then Fe²■ enters the cells via the DMT-1 transporter (Option C).   Inside the duodenal cell, Fe²■ can either be stored as mucosal iron or transported into the bloodstream.   Fe²■ exits the cell through ferroportin (Option A).   In the blood, Fe²■ is oxidized to Fe³■ by hephaestin (Option B) and ceruloplasmin.   Fe³■ binds to transferrin for delivery to the bone marrow, where it is stored as ferritin; in cases of hemolysis, ferritin aggregates to form hemosiderin. The liver secretes hepcidin (Option D), a protein that regulates iron absorption. When iron stores are adequate, hepcidin downregulates ferroportin expression, reducing iron absorption."

        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Decreased serum ferritin levels Explanation:   Serum ferritin is a key marker used in diagnosing iron deficiency anemia.   In iron deficiency, ferritin levels are decreased because ferritin stores decrease as iron stores deplete. (Option A and D)   Serum ferritin levels below 30 ng/mL are generally considered indicative of depleted iron stores and are a reliable marker for iron deficiency. Serum ferritin is the gold standard investigation (Option B): While serum ferritin is commonly used as a marker for iron stores, it is not considered the gold standard test for diagnosing iron deficiency. A bone marrow aspirate to directly assess iron stores is the gold standard for diagnosing iron deficiency."

        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Duodenum Explanation: The given clinical presentation of low hemoglobin, increased RDW, and microcytic hypochromic red cells on peripheral smear, points towards the diagnosis of Iron deficiency anemia. Iron is primarily absorbed through the duodenal mucosa, making duodenum the most likely site of absorption. Metabolism of iron:   Iron from the diet (heme and non-heme) is converted to ferrous form in the stomach.   Heme iron is primarily found in animal-based foods, while non heme iron is found in plant-based foods and iron-fortified foods.   In the duodenum, ferrous iron is absorbed via DMT1 and transported into enterocytes.   Inside, it binds to ferritin or enters the bloodstream via ferroportin.   Iron binds to transferrin in the blood, facilitating its delivery to tissues for functions like hemoglobin synthesis.   Hepcidin, a peptide hormone produced by the liver, plays a crucial role in regulating iron homeostasis. Jejunum (Option A) absorbs nutrients like amino acids, glucose, fatty acids, and folic acid. Ileum (Option B) completes nutrient absorption, including bile salts, vitamin B12, and remaining nutrients, before the material enters the colon. Colon (Option D) focuses on absorbing water, electrolytes like sodium and chloride, and some vitamins from gut bacteria, such as vitamin K and biotin."

        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Raised urinary methylmalonic acid levels Explanation: Plasma and urinary methylmalonic acid levels will be elevated in case of vitamin B12 deficiency but not with folate deficiency. This is because the enzyme methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase's isomerisation of methylmalonyl coenzyme A to succinyl coenzyme A requires adenosylcobalamin (a form of vitamin B12) as a cofactor. A deficiency of vitamin B12 thus leads to increased plasma and urine levels of methylmalonic acid. Vitamin B12 is key in converting homocysteine to methionine; hence, its deficiency will lead to elevated homocysteine levels (Option A) rather than reduction. Neurological symptoms will remain the same, if not worsen, after folate administration in case of Vitamin B12 deficient megaloblastic anaemia (Option B). Improvement in symptoms and reduction in megaloblastic count occur after folate administration, even if the anaemia is due to Vitamin B12 deficiency (Option D)."

        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Deficiency of folic acid is present Explanation:   Elevated urinary levels of formiminoglutamic acid (FIGlu) in a patient to whom histidine is given suggests the presence of folic acid deficiency. This is called the FIGlu test.   Folic acid is normally required in its tetrahydrofolate form to regulate DNA synthesis and the production of methionine, glutamate, etc.   Formiminoglutamic acid derived from histidine will be converted to glutamate in the presence of folic acid.   If there is a folic acid deficiency, this conversion will not occur, leading to elevated urinary formiminoglutamic acid.

Hence, serum/red cell folate can lead to the aetiology behind this presentation.   Schilling test is done by orally administering the patient with radioactive vitamin B12 and checking its presence in the urine. If present, as with this case, it is understood that there is no problem with the absorption.

        "solution": "Correct Option D - Iron deficiency anemia:   Iron deficiency anemia is characterized by a deficiency of iron, a key component required for hemoglobin synthesis in red blood cells. Microcytic anemia, where the red blood cells are smaller than normal, is a hallmark of iron deficiency. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and pale skin are classic signs of anemia. Iron deficiency can be caused by inadequate dietary intake, chronic blood loss (such as from menstruation or gastrointestinal bleeding), or poor iron absorption.   Based on the patient's presentation of microcytic anemia along with the symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and pale skin, the most likely diagnosis is D. Iron deficiency anemia. Incorrect Options: Option A - Alcoholism: Alcoholism can lead to various health issues, including anemia. However, in this case, the patient's presentation of fatigue, weakness, and pale skin along with microcytic anemia suggests a more specific cause related to iron deficiency. Option B - Chronic Kidney Disease: Chronic kidney disease can cause anemia due to reduced production of erythropoietin (a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production) by the kidneys. However, anemia caused by chronic kidney disease is usually normocytic or normochromic rather than microcytic. Option C - Hemolytic Anemia: Hemolytic anemia results from the destruction of red blood cells at a rate that exceeds their production. It can lead to a variety of symptoms, including fatigue and pale skin. However, microcytic anemia is typically associated with conditions related to impaired hemoglobin synthesis, like iron deficiency anemia, rather than hemolysis"

Ferroportin is a protein that functions as an iron exporter, allowing iron to exit from cells into the bloodstream, where it can be utilized for various physiological processes including red blood cell production. When ferroportin is inhibited, it leads to reduced iron export from cells and contributes to iron retention within the cells.In chronic inflammatory conditions, such as the one mentioned in the question, there is an increased production of IL-6. IL-6 has been shown to stimulate the production of hepcidin, a peptide hormone synthesized in the liver. Hepcidin regulates iron homeostasis by binding to ferroportin and causing its internalization and degradation. This action reduces iron export from cells, leading to decreased iron availability for erythropoiesis (red blood cell production). Consequently, chronic inflammation-induced elevation of IL-6 and subsequent increase in hepcidin levels result in reduced iron absorption and availability for red blood cell formation, leading to microcytic hypochromic anemia. Incorrect Options: Option A - IL-1: Interleukin-1 is also involved in inflammation and immune responses, but it does not have a direct role in inhibiting ferroportin. It can contribute to inflammation-induced systemic responses. Option C - IFN-gamma: Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is primarily involved in immune responses and has not been directly implicated in the inhibition of ferroportin. Option D - TNF-Alpha: Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is another cytokine involved in inflammation. It does contribute to the inflammatory response, but it is not the primary cytokine responsible for inhibiting ferroportin."

        },
        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Option B - Duodenum:   In the given scenario, an elderly woman who underwent surgical resection of her bowel presents with easy fatiguability and tiredness along with macrocytic anemia; the likely cause is vitamin B12 and Vitamin B9 deficiency. Absorption of B12 occurs mainly in the stomach and ileum, whereas folic acid absorption occurs mainly in the jejunum. So, resection of the duodenum is least likely to cause macrocytic anemia. Incorrect Options: Option A - Jejunum: Folic acid absorption occurs mainly in the jejunum. Therefore, it can contribute to malabsorption and is likely to cause macrocytic anemia. Option C - Ileum: As mentioned earlier, the ileum is the primary site of vitamin B12 absorption. Resection of the ileum can lead to impaired absorption and subsequent deficiency, resulting in macrocytic anemia. Option D - Stomach: The stomach plays a role in the absorption of vitamin B12 through the release of intrinsic factor, a protein required for vitamin B12 absorption in the ileum. So the resection of the stomach is expected to cause macrocytic anemia."

        "solution": "Correct Option B - Low serum ferritin:   Anemia of chronic disease is a type of anemia that occurs in people with chronic medical conditions such as chronic infections, inflammatory diseases, and cancer.   In anemia of chronic disease, the body's response to chronic inflammation or infection leads to decreased production of red blood cells and anemia.   The iron levels in the body are typically normal or high in anemia of chronic disease.   This is because the body's response to chronic inflammation or infection increases the production of a protein called hepcidin, which inhibits the absorption of iron from the diet and sequesters iron in the body's stores, leading to increased ferritin levels. Incorrect Options: Option A - High serum hepcidin:   Hepcidin is a hormone produced by the liver and is a key regulator of iron metabolism.   In anemia of chronic disease, there is an increase in serum hepcidin levels.   Hepcidin acts by reducing iron absorption from the gut and inhibiting iron release from macrophages, ultimately leading to decreased iron availability for red blood cell production. Option C - Chronic infection:   Chronic infection is one of the underlying causes of anemia of chronic disease.   Inflammatory mediators produced during chronic infection can disrupt iron metabolism and lead to anemia. Option D - Normal iron stores:   In anemia of chronic disease, there is a disruption in iron utilization and distribution, leading to functional iron deficiency.   This means that although iron stores may appear normal or even elevated, there is a decreased availability of iron for erythropoiesis."

        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Option B - Leukemia:   Leukemia is not likely to be seen in a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.   PNH is a rare acquired hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by a deficiency of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins on the surface of blood cells, particularly red blood cells.   A mutation in the PIGA gene causes this deficiency.   While PNH is associated with various complications, including hemolysis, aplastic anemia, and thrombosis, it does not lead to the development of leukemia. Incorrect Options: Option A - Aplastic anemia:   Aplastic anemia is commonly associated with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.   In PNH, the bone marrow fails to produce an adequate number of blood cells, including RBCs, white blood cells, and platelets.   This bone marrow failure can manifest as aplastic anemia, characterized by a decrease in all three blood cell lineages.   Aplastic anemia is a frequent complication of PNH and can contribute to the clinical manifestations and morbidity associated with the condition. Option C - Thrombosis:   Thrombosis is a common feature of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.   PNH is associated with the presence of abnormal RBCs lacking GPI-anchored proteins, such as CD55 and CD59, which protect against complement-mediated hemolysis.   The absence of these proteins leads to chronic intravascular hemolysis, resulting in the release of free hemoglobin and activation of the complement system.   The activation of the complement system and subsequent formation of complement-mediated microthrombi can lead to thrombosis in various organs, including the liver, kidneys, and brain. Option D - Hemolysis:   Hemolysis is a hallmark feature of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.   The absence of GPI-anchored proteins on the surface of RBCs renders them susceptible to complement-mediated destruction.   The complement system is activated by the presence of abnormal RBCs, leading to intravascular hemolysis and the release of free hemoglobin into the circulation.   The hemolysis in PNH is often paroxysmal, meaning it occurs in episodes and is exacerbated during periods of stress or at night."

        },
        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Option B - Ferritin translation is decreased by binding IRP to IRE:   In iron deficiency anemia, the intracellular regulation of iron involves the interaction between iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) and iron-responsive elements (IREs) present in the mRNA molecules of key iron-related proteins.   Ferritin is a protein that serves as an intracellular storage form of iron.   Its translation is regulated by the binding of IRP to the IRE present in the mRNA of ferritin.   When intracellular iron levels are low, IRP binds to the IRE in the ferritin mRNA, preventing its translation.   This leads to a decrease in the production of ferritin, which helps conserve iron and prevent its storage when it is limited. Incorrect Options: Option A - Ferritin translation is increased by binding IRP to IRE:   In iron deficiency anemia, the binding of IRP to the IRE in the mRNA of ferritin leads to a decrease in ferritin translation.   This is to conserve iron and prevent its storage when it is limited. Option C - Transferrin receptor 1 translation is unaffected by binding IRP to IRE:   Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) is a protein involved in the uptake of iron into cells.   Its translation is also regulated by the interaction between IRP and IRE.   In iron deficiency, IRP binds to the IRE in the mRNA of TfR1, stabilizing the mRNA and increasing its translation.   This results in an increased production of TfR1, which enhances the uptake of iron into cells to compensate for the deficiency. Option D - Transferrin receptor 1 translation is decreased by binding IRP to IRE:   In iron deficiency anemia, the binding of IRP to the IRE in the mRNA of TfR1 leads to an increased translation of TfR1.   This helps facilitate the increased uptake of iron into cells to overcome the deficiency."

        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Option B - Bite cells are present:   Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an inherited enzyme deficiency that affects red blood cells.   It is characterized by a deficiency of the G6PD enzyme, which plays a role in protecting red blood cells from oxidative damage.   In G6PD deficiency, the red blood cells are more susceptible to oxidative stress and may undergo hemolysis.   One of the morphological characteristics associated with G6PD deficiency is the presence of Bite cell/ Degmacyte.   Oxidative stress causes denaturation of hemoglobin and leads to formation of Heinz bodies.   Heinz bodies are not stained with Romanowsky family stains.   If Romanowsky stains are used, the denatured hemoglobin may not appear and it produces an illustration of a bite cell.

        "solution": "Correct Answer: D) Hypercellular bone marrow with decreased erythroid precursors Explanation:   The features described in the scenario are consistent with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML).   CML typically presents with splenomegaly, high white blood cell counts, and a characteristic peripheral blood smear showing increased granulocytes at different stages of maturation. Bone Marrow aspirate findings of CML:   Presence of scattered macrophages with abundant wrinkled, green-blue cytoplasm, called sea-blue histiocytes or pseudo-Gaucher cells.   The marrow is markedly hypercellular due to massively increased numbers of maturing granulocytic precursors (elevated eosinophils and basophils)   Increased megakaryocytes, commonly with small, dysplastic forms called dwarf megakaryocytes.   Normal or slightly decreased erythroid progenitors (increased myeloid : erythroid ratio).   Increased deposition of reticulin fibers. Diffusely effaced lymph node architecture with proliferation centers is seen in CLL (Option A). Reed-Sternberg cells are pathognomonic for Hodgkin’s lymphoma (Option B).

        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) CD5+, CD19+, CD23+, CD10- Explanation: Lab investigations with CBC showing leukocytosis with ALC >=5000/mm3 points towards diagnosis of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL). It is characterised by specific cell surface markers detected via flow cytometry.   The typical CLL immunophenotype includes CD5+, CD10-, CD19+, CD20+ (with dim expression), and CD23+.   While CD5 is associated with T-cells, it's abnormally expressed in CLL. CD19 and CD20 are B-cell markers, with CD20 typically appearing dim in CLL. CD23 is also commonly found on CLL cells.   Additionally, a new marker, CD200, is recorded positive in CLL, aiding in its diagnosis. CD20+, CD79a+, CD5+, CD25-: CD79a is more common in B-cell lymphomas, and CD25 can be seen in other diseases like hairy cell leukemia (Option B).

        "solution": "Correct Answer: D) Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia Explanation: The clinical presentation suggests Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia, a lymphoproliferative disorder characterised by the presence of monoclonal IgM antibodies. Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (WM):   Increased association with Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma (LPL)   It is also associated with MYD 88 mutation.   Patients may present with symptoms of hyperviscosity syndrome, such as blurred vision, dizziness, and bleeding tendencies.   Diagnosis: monoclonal IgM gammopathy on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) or immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) Hyperviscosity Syndrome:   Caused by high levels of IgM increasing blood viscosity.   Visual Impairment: Sluggish blood flow and venous congestion in the retinal veins cause visual disturbances, retinal haemorrhages, and exudates.   Neurological Issues: Reduced brain blood flow leads to headaches, dizziness, deafness, and stupor.   Bleeding: Macroglobulins form complexes with clotting factors and interfere with platelet function, increasing bleeding risk.   Cryoglobulinemia: Macroglobulins precipitate at low temperatures, causing Raynaud phenomenon and cold urticaria.   Treatment: Observation, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity symptoms. Multiple Myeloma (Option A): Multiple myeloma is characterised by the presence of monoclonal IgG or IgA antibodies, not IgM. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (Option B): CLL is a B-cell malignancy characterised by the accumulation of monoclonal B lymphocytes and not IgM antibodies.

        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Explanation:   Based on the clinical scenario and the bone marrow findings, the most likely diagnosis is Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).   Blasts in the bone marrow are a pivotal factor in diagnosing different types of leukaemia.   When the bone marrow contains over 20% blasts, it indicates acute leukaemia rather than a chronic condition.   Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is characterised by the rapid proliferation of abnormal myeloid blasts (Myeloblasts are identified by the presence of Auer rods), crowding out normal cells and leading to the symptoms observed. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) (Option A):   CLL typically presents with mature lymphocytes, not blasts, in the bone marrow, distinguishing it from AML.   Histopathology reveals smudge cells. The elevated blast count seen in the bone marrow biopsy is not characteristic of CLL. Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (Option C):   HL is diagnosed via lymph node biopsy revealing Reed-Sternberg cells, not through a bone marrow biopsy showing high blast counts.   The hallmark of HL is the presence of specific large abnormal lymphocytes, not blasts.HL primarily involves lymph nodes, with systemic symptoms such as night sweats and weight loss. Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) (Option D):   The diagnosis of NHL involves malignant lymphoid cells in affected tissues, not an increased blast percentage in the bone marrow."

        },
        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct answer: A) CD13+, CD33+, CD34+, HLA-DR+ Explanation: The peripheral smear shows myeloblasts (large, irregularly shaped cells with prominent nuclei and moderately granular cytoplasm), and needle-like inclusions in the cytoplasm of blasts (Auer rods), suggesting acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The immunophenotype associated with AML is CD13+, CD33+, CD34+, and HLA-DR+.   AML is characterised by the presence of myeloid lineage markers.   CD13, CD33, and CD34 are commonly expressed on AML blasts.   Additionally, the presence of HLA-DR is typical in AML immunophenotyping. CD19+, CD20-, CD22+, CD79a- (Option B):   This immunophenotyping pattern is characteristic of B-cell ALL.   In B-ALL, blasts typically express B-cell markers such as CD19, CD22, and CD79a.   CD20 expression is variable but often negative in B-ALL. CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD5- (Option C):   This immunophenotyping pattern is indicative of T-cell ALL.

          "D": "Myeloproliferative disorder"
        },
        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct answer: C) Aleukemic leukaemia Explanation:   In this scenario, the patient presents with pancytopenia, fatigue, easy bruising, and recurrent infections. The absence of blast cells in the peripheral smear despite the presence of cytopenias suggests aleukemic leukaemia.   Aleukemic leukaemia or aleukemic leukaemia cutis is leukaemia without circulating blast cells in the peripheral blood. While blast cells may be absent in the peripheral smear, they can still be present in the bone marrow. The malignant white cells invade the skin before they appear in the peripheral blood or bone marrow.   Patients may present with symptoms similar to other types of leukaemia, including fatigue, weakness, fever, weight loss, and easy bruising or bleeding.   Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, as the absence of blast cells in the peripheral blood smear can make it challenging to identify.   A bone marrow biopsy may reveal the presence of leukaemia cells, aiding in diagnosis. Aplastic anemia (Option A):   Aplastic anaemia is characterised by pancytopenia (low red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) due to bone marrow failure.   Unlike leukaemia, it does not involve the overproduction of immature cells (blast cells) and does not typically present with blasts on peripheral smears. Myelodysplasia (Option B):   Myelodysplasia, or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), is a group of blood disorders characterised by abnormal development and function of blood-forming cells in the bone marrow.   In MDS, the bone marrow produces immature or defective blood cells that may not function properly. Myeloproliferative disorder (Option D):   Myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) are a group of conditions characterised by excessive production of mature blood cells.   Unlike leukaemia, MPDs do not typically present with pancytopenia (reduced levels of all blood cell types) and do not involve the overproduction of blast cells seen in leukaemia."

        },
        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) MYC gene Explanation: The clinical presentation with mandibular mass and a starry sky appearance on HPE are characteristic of Burkitt’s lymphoma, which is associated with the translocation of the MYC gene on chromosome 8, thus leading to overexpression of the MYC protein.   All forms of Burkitt’s lymphoma (Endemic, Sporadic and HIV associated) are associated with such translocations.   The most common translocations are t (8:2), t(8:14), and t(8:22). BCL2 gene (Option B) translocation is associated with follicular lymphoma. The most common is t(14;18), leading to the juxtaposition of the IGH locus (Ch 14) with the BCL2 locus(Ch 18), leading to overexpression of BCL2. Cyclin-D1 (Option C) gene translocation is associated with all mantle cell lymphoma. There is a translocation of the cyclin D1 locus on chromosome 11 and IGH locus on chromosome 14; t(11;14), which results in overexpression of cyclin D1, thus promoting G1 to S-phase progression in the cell cycle. BCL6 gene (Option D) dysregulation is associated with Diffuse large B cell lymphoma. It can occur due to translocations or promoter sequence mutations of the BCL6 gene on Chr. 3q27."

          "D": "Solitary plasmacytoma."
        },
        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Option A - Multiple myeloma:   Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that produces antibodies. It is characterized by the presence of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow, which can lead to bone destruction and the release of monoclonal (abnormal) immunoglobulins or light chains into the bloodstream. The clinical presentation of low back ache, progressive pallor (anemia), deranged kidney function tests (KFT), disproportionately increased gamma globulin levels, and lytic lesions on X-ray spine are all consistent with multiple myeloma. Incorrect Options: Option B - MGUS (Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance): MGUS is a benign condition where a small amount of abnormal plasma cells produce a monoclonal protein (usually immunoglobulin) in the blood. It is generally asymptomatic and does not cause significant organ damage. The patient in the scenario has more severe symptoms and findings that are not typical for MGUS. Option C - Immunoglobulin Light Chain Amyloidosis (AL): AL amyloidosis is a rare condition where abnormal light chain proteins are deposited as amyloid in various organs, including the kidneys. This can lead to organ dysfunction. While AL amyloidosis can cause kidney involvement and abnormal levels of light chains, the lytic bone lesions seen on X-ray and the disproportionately increased gamma globulin levels are not characteristic of AL amyloidosis. Option D - Solitary Plasmacytoma: Solitary plasmacytoma is a localized tumor of plasma cells that typically presents as a single mass in bone or soft tissue. It is less likely in this case because the patient has multiple lytic lesions on X-ray spine, which indicates widespread bone involvement. Solitary plasmacytoma typically doesn't show this pattern of multiple bone lesions."

        "solution": "Correct Option A - Polycythemia vera:   The JAK2 mutation is most commonly associated with polycythemia vera, a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by an overproduction of red blood cells.   In polycythemia vera, the JAK2 mutation leads to the constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which results in uncontrolled proliferation and survival of red blood cell precursors.   This causes an increase in the number of red blood cells in the bloodstream, leading to thickening of the blood and potential complications such as thrombosis. Incorrect Options: Option B - Essential thrombocytosis:   While JAK2 mutations can also occur in ET, they are less common compared to polycythemia vera.   ET is characterized by the overproduction of platelets in the bone marrow, leading to an increased risk of abnormal blood clotting. Option C - CML:   The majority of CML is associated with the Philadelphia chromosome, which results from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22.

Platelet dysfunction(Option B) Platelet dysfunction typically presents with symptoms such as easy bruising and recurrent nosebleeds. However, a prolonged aPTT typically indicates a defect in the coagulation cascade rather than platelet dysfunction. Vitamin K deficiency(Option D) vitamin K is crucial for synthesizing coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X. Its deficiency can lead to prolonged PT and aPTT.

        },
        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) No platelet aggregation Explanation: The decrease in light transmission observed during platelet aggregometry indicates no platelet aggregation.   This test measures platelet adhesion, secretion, and aggregation by passing light through platelet-rich plasma.   Initially, light transmission is reduced as the cells are dispersed through plasma.   Upon the addition of agonists like ristocetin, ADP, epinephrine, and collagen, platelet aggregation occurs, creating clots that allow light to transmit (Option A). Therefore, a decrease in light transmission signifies the absence of platelet aggregates. (Option B) Serum sodium (Option C): Serum sodium levels are not directly assessed or measured during platelet aggregometry. Increase in plasma fibrinogen (Option D): Platelet aggregometry primarily assesses platelet function and aggregation, not plasma fibrinogen levels. Therefore, a decrease in light transmission during the test is unrelated to increased plasma fibrinogen."

        },
        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Bleeding Time (BT) Explanation:   The symptoms described—frequent nosebleeds, heavy menstrual periods, prolonged bleeding after minor cuts, and easy bruising—are characteristic of a primary hemostasis disorder, which involves platelet function.   The Bleeding Time (BT) test assesses the function of platelets and their ability to form a primary hemostatic plug. Normal BT is 2 to 9 minutes and is prolonged when there is a defect in platelet function. Clotting time (CT) (Option B): The clotting time (CT) reflects the time needed for clot formation rather than platelet function. Normal CT: 8-15 mins. Prothrombin time (PT) (Option C):   Prothrombin time is used to assess both extrinsic and common coagulation pathways.   Deficits or dysfunctions of factors 1, 2, 5, 7, or 10 can cause a prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Normal PT: 11-16 secs.   INR = PT of patient / PT of a normal person. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (Option D):   Activated partial prothrombin time is used to study intrinsic and common coagulation processes. Normal aPTT: 25-30 secs.

        },
        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Factor XIII Explanation:   Factor XIII is crucial for maintaining clot stability and promoting fibrin polymer cross-linking, ensuring effective hemostasis.   Its deficiency can lead to prolonged bleeding from the umbilical stump in neonates, as seen in this case. Other symptoms include severe menstrual bleeding, hemarthrosis, repeated early pregnancy loss, and delayed postoperative bleeding.   Unlike other factors, Factor XIII deficiency does not affect BT, CT, PT, aPTT, or platelet count. Diagnosis is confirmed with a urea clot solubility test, in which the clot dissolves if Factor XIII is deficient. Factor VIII deficiency (Option A):   Hemophilia A, or Factor VIII deficiency is an X-linked disorder, characterized by elevated aPTT and causes deep tissue and joint bleeding.   Von Willebrand factor (vWF) protects Factor VIII from degradation, and its deficiency can lead to reduced Factor VIII levels, resulting in a condition called pseudohemophilia. Factor IV deficiency (Option C): Factor IV (calcium) is essential for the coagulation cascade, activating Factor X in intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. However, calcium deficiency is extremely rare and not associated with umbilical stump bleeding; it typically causes widespread bleeding. Factor IX deficiency (Option D): Factor IX deficiency (Hemophilia B or Christmas disease) is an X-linked recessive disorder affecting the intrinsic pathway, causing elevated aPTT with normal PT. Like Hemophilia A, it primarily leads to deep tissue and joint bleeding."

The most common type. Mild to moderate vWF deficiency. Quantitative defect. point substitutions prevent the vWF protein from maturing or cause it to leave the plasma quicklyAutosomal dominant. Qualitative defect. Types: 2A, 2B, 2M, 2N 2A (Most common) - Decrease in binding between vWF and Gp1b/9 (Option B) missense mutations cause faulty multimer formation → the most active forms of vWF, i.e. large- and intermediate-sized multimers are absent. 2B - Increase in binding between vWF and Gp1b/9 (Option C) 2M - VWF dependant platelet adhesion is decreased. There is impairment of VWF binding to platelets. Type 2M VWD typically has mild to moderate mucocutaneous bleeding 2N - There is marked decline in the binding affinity for factor VIII. The level of factor VIII is lower when compared to the VWF:Ag. This led to misdiagnosis as haemophilia AAutosomal recessive. Quantitative defect. produced by frameshift mutations or deletions affecting both alleles (autosomal recessive), which produce little or no vWF. Factor VIII levels are also lowered because vWF stabilizes factor VIII in the blood, and the resulting bleeding condition is severe."

        },
        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Gp1b-IX Explanation: Gp1b-IX is a membrane complex in platelets that facilitates binding to the von Willebrand Factor, which is defective/deficient in von Willebrand disease. gpIIb-IIIa (Option B): This glycoprotein complex is crucial for platelet aggregation, the final step in primary hemostasis. It binds fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor (vWF), aiding in the formation of platelet plugs. However, defects in gpIIb-IIIa are not associated with von Willebrand Disease (vWD). Factor IX (Option C): Factor IX (or Christmas factor) is a vitamin K-dependent clotting factor, part of the intrinsic clotting pathway. Factor IX deficiency is known as Hemophilia B, an X-linked recessive disorder. Factor XIII (Option D): Factor XIII stabilises fibrin by cross linking and deficiency leads to severe bleeding."

        "answer": 4,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: D) Febrile Non-hemolytic reaction Explanation : Febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs) are the most common complication of blood transfusions. These reactions typically occur when the recipient's immune system responds to the transfused blood product's white blood cells or cytokines. FNHTRs are characterised by fever and chills during or shortly after a transfusion. Pathophysiology: FNHTRs are typically caused by: Management:   Stop the Transfusion.   Supportive Care.   Antipyretics. Prevention:   Using leukoreduced blood products (where leukocytes are removed before storage) can significantly reduce the incidence of FNHTRs.   Pre-storage Leukoreduction: This technique is more effective in reducing FNHTRs than bedside filtration.   Use of Leukoreduction filter filters out white blood cells (WBCs) from blood products to reduce adverse transfusion reactions. Lowers the risk of alloimmunization to human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). Minimizes immune responses caused by donor leukocytes. Reduces cytomegalovirus transmission since the virus resides in WBCs.

Minimizes immune responses caused by donor leukocytes.   Reduces cytomegalovirus transmission since the virus resides in WBCs. TRALI (Transfusion-related acute lung injury) (Option A) is a serious transfusion reaction characterised by acute respiratory distress and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. It typically occurs within 6 hours of transfusion and is caused by an immune response to donor antibodies or bioactive substances in the transfused blood. TACO (Transfusion-associated circulatory overload) (Option B) occurs when a transfusion is administered too quickly or when the volume of transfused blood exceeds the recipient's circulatory capacity. It leads to volume overload and pulmonary edema due to increased hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary vasculature. Delayed hemolytic reactions (Option C) occur days to weeks after a transfusion and are caused by an immune response to minor antigens on transfused red blood cells. Symptoms may include mild fever, jaundice, and a gradual decline in hemoglobin levels due to hemolysis."

        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Metabolic Acidosis Explanation: Metabolic acidosis can occur in the setting of shock and hypoperfusion rather than directly from the transfusion itself, so it is not likely seen in massive blood transfusion. Due to the large volume of blood and blood products administered, massive blood transfusion can lead to various complications. Complications of massive blood transfusion:   Hypocalcemia (Option D): Packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and other blood products are preserved with citrate, an anticoagulant. Citrate binds to ionized calcium (Ca² ■) in the recipient's blood, reducing the free calcium level - hypocalcemia Presents as muscle spasms, cardiac arrhythmias, and decreased myocardial contractility.   Packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and other blood products are preserved with citrate, an anticoagulant.   Citrate binds to ionized calcium (Ca²■) in the recipient's blood, reducing the free calcium level - hypocalcemia   Presents as muscle spasms, cardiac arrhythmias, and decreased myocardial contractility.   Metabolic Alkalosis (Option A): Citrate is metabolized in the liver to bicarbonate (HCO■■). Rapid transfusion of citrate-containing blood products can overwhelm the liver’s ability to metabolize citrate, leading to an increase in bicarbonate levels. This results in metabolic alkalosis   Citrate is metabolized in the liver to bicarbonate (HCO■■).   Rapid transfusion of citrate-containing blood products can overwhelm the liver’s ability to metabolize citrate, leading to an increase in bicarbonate levels.   This results in metabolic alkalosis   Hyperkalemia (Option C): Stored blood undergoes hemolysis over time, releasing potassium from red blood cells into the plasma. Transfusion of large volumes of stored blood can introduce a significant potassium load, causing hyperkalemia. Presents with cardiac arrhythmias, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney dysfunction.   Stored blood undergoes hemolysis over time, releasing potassium from red blood cells into the plasma.   Transfusion of large volumes of stored blood can introduce a significant potassium load, causing hyperkalemia.   Presents with cardiac arrhythmias, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney dysfunction.   Hypothermia: Rapid transfusion of cold-stored blood products (typically kept at 1–6°C) can lower the patient’s core body temperature..   Rapid transfusion of cold-stored blood products (typically kept at 1–6°C) can lower the patient’s core body temperature..   Coagulopathy: Massive transfusion dilutes clotting factors and platelets, leading to dilutional coagulopathy. Hypothermia and hypocalcemia exacerbate this by impairing the function of coagulation enzymes and platelets.   Massive transfusion dilutes clotting factors and platelets, leading to dilutional coagulopathy.   Hypothermia and hypocalcemia exacerbate this by impairing the function of coagulation enzymes and platelets.   Hypokalemia: Post-transfusion, potassium that had leaked out of stored red blood cells can re-enter the cells in vivo. This shift can lead to hypokalemia, especially if the patient has a strong cellular uptake of potassium.

Non-immune Factors: Biological response modifiers like cytokines and lipids that accumulate during blood product storage can also contribute. Prevention:   Using plasma from male or female donors who have never been pregnant (nulliparous) can reduce the risk, as they are less likely to have antibodies that can cause TRALI.   Blood banks may screen donors for antibodies known to cause TRALI. TACO is characterised by a gradual onset of respiratory distress and cardiogenic pulmonary edema within 24 hours of transfusion(Option B). It occurs when a patient receives a transfusion volume that exceeds their circulatory capacity, leading to fluid overload and cardiac dysfunction. Acute onset of fever and chills without respiratory symptoms (Option C) is seen in febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR), which are characterised by fever and chills without respiratory distress. Gradual onset of jaundice and anemia several days after transfusion (Option D) is more indicative of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, which occur days to weeks after transfusion."

It results from defective desquamation, causing retention of abnormally formed scales. Freckles (Option A): Freckles (Ephelides) are small, tan-red or light brown macules that appear after sun exposure. They result from increased melanin pigment within basal keratinocytes, not excess keratin. The number of melanocytes is normal, but the degree of pigmentation changes with sun exposure. Lentigo (Option B): Lentigo refers to benign localised hyperplasia of melanocytes. It presents as small, oval, tan-brown macules or patches. Unlike freckles, lentigines do not darken with sun exposure. The key feature is linear melanocytic hyperplasia restricted to the cell layer above the basement membrane without excess keratin. Nevus (Mole) (Option C): Nevi are benign neoplasms of melanocytes, often caused by mutations leading to activation of the RAS signalling pathway.

        "question": "A 70-year-old woman presents with a finding as shown in the image. A biopsy confirms basal cell carcinoma. Which molecular pathway is primarily involved?",
        "options": {
          "A": "Hippo pathway signaling",
          "B": "Hedgehog signaling pathway",
          "C": "WNT signaling",
          "D": "RAS/MAPK signaling"
        },
        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Hedgehog signaling pathway Explanation: The hedgehog signaling pathway is associated with the pathogenesis of basal cell carcinoma, a locally aggressive cutaneous tumour.   They present as pearly papules containing dilated blood vessels (telangiectasias)   They may ulcerate locally and invade the underlying bone or facial sinuses (rodent ulcers). Histologically, the tumour cells are basophilic cells with hyperchromatic nuclei (basaloid cells) arranged in clusters with a palisading pattern. The stroma sometimes retracts from the malignant cells. Hippo pathway signaling (Option A): It is seen in Neurofibromatosis type 2, an autosomal dominant disease, due to mutations in the NF2 gene causing activation of the protein, merlin. It presents with acoustic schwannoma and meningioma. WNT signaling pathway (Option C): This pathway is implicated in various familial colonic polyps and carcinomas of the stomach, colon, and pancreas, as well as melanomas. It is disrupted by mutations in the APC gene, which result in dysregulation of the adenomatous polyposis coli protein and subsequent abnormal activation of the WNT signaling pathway. RAS/MAPK signaling (Option D): Inhibition of RAS/MAPK signaling is seen in Neurofibromatosis type 1. This is due to mutations in the NF1 gene that produce Neurofibromin-1. It presents with neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, neuroblastoma and juvenile myeloid leukaemia."

        },
        "answer": 4,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: D) Associated with loss of nucleotide excision repair mechanism. Explanation: Loss of nucleotide excision repair mechanism is associated with Xeroderma pigmentosum and these patients are at increased risk of squamous cell and basal cell skin cancers due to exposure to UV light because of an inability to repair pyrimidine dimers.   The clinical presentation is suggestive of Gorlin syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder (Option C) characterised by the development of multiple basal cell carcinomas before age 20.   It also presents with various other tumours like medulloblastomas, ovarian fibromas, odontogenic keratocysts (Option A) and pits of the palms and soles.   The gene associated is PTCH, a tumour suppressor gene (Option B)   Patients with Gorlin syndrome inherit one defective PTCH allele; the remaining normal allele undergoes UV-induced mutation. This mutation activates SMO and GLI1, contributing to basal cell carcinoma development."

        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) CK20 Explanation: The given clinical scenario points towards the diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma, a highly aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancer characterised by rapid growth, early metastasis, and a high mortality rate.   Predisposing factors include immune suppression, sun exposure, and advanced age.   Most MCCs involve the clonal integration of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), which is crucial for tumour growth.   It typically presents as a fast-growing, reddish, firm nodule on sun-exposed skin.   CK20 is a cytoskeletal protein commonly expressed in Merkel Cell Carcinoma, hence used as a specific marker.   Its characteristic perinuclear dot-like staining pattern is a key diagnostic feature. S-100 (Option A) and Melan-A (Option C) are more useful in the diagnosis of Melanoma and are not typically associated with Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) p40 (Option D) is a marker commonly used in diagnosing squamous cell carcinoma and not useful in Merkel cell carcinoma."

        },
        "answer": 3,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: C) Sawtoothing of the dermoe-pidermal junction Explanation: The given clinical scenario and histological features point towards the diagnosis of lichen planus, which presents as itchy, violaceous, flat-topped papules with Wickham striae that can coalesce to form plaques.   They are typically distributed symmetrically on the extremities, wrists, and elbows, and oral mucosa is commonly involved.   Histologically, lichen planus is characterised by a dense lymphocytic infiltrate along the dermo-epidermal junction, resulting in a sawtooth appearance. Basal keratinocytes exhibit degeneration, and Civatte bodies (anucleate, necrotic basal cells) are often observed in the papillary dermis. Munro microabscesses (Option A) are histological findings typically seen in psoriasis, not lichen planus. They are collections of neutrophils within the stratum corneum of the epidermis. Spongiform pustules (Option B) are also characteristic histological findings seen in psoriasis. They represent collections of neutrophils within the superficial epidermis, forming interconnected spaces. Follicular lipping (Option D) is a histological finding seen in seborrheic dermatitis, not lichen planus. It refers to mounds of parakeratosis containing neutrophils and serum at the Ostia of hair follicles."

        },
        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Suprabasal split Explanation:   The given clinical scenario is consistent with Pemphigus vulgaris, in which the split occurs above the basal layer of the epidermis, leading to a suprabasal split.   This is due to autoantibodies targeting desmoglein proteins, causing acantholysis (loss of cell adhesion) and blister formation above the basal layer. Subcorneal split (Option A) is a type of split that occurs just below the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epidermis. It is characteristic of pemphigus foliaceus, where the blister forms beneath the stratum corneum. Subepidermal split (Option C) is a type of split that occurs beneath the entire epidermis, within the dermis. It is typical of bullous pemphigoid and dermatitis herpetiformis. In bullous pemphigoid, autoantibodies target components of the basement membrane, causing separationat this level. Junctional split (Option D) is a split occurring at the level of the lamina lucida within the basement membrane zone, often seen in junctional epidermolysis bullosa. This condition involves genetic mutations affecting proteins that anchor the epidermis to the dermis, leading to fragile skin that blisters easily."

        "answer": 1,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: A) Cylindroma Explanation: The clinical and histological features described in the scenario are consistent with Cylindroma, benign skin tumours that often appear on the scalp and forehead.   They exhibit ductal differentiation and histologically present as basaloid cell islands fitting together like a \"jigsaw puzzle\" within a fibrous stroma.   These tumours can merge over time to form larger, turban-like growths.   They may be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion due to mutations in the CYLD gene.   Cylindromas are also associated with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, characterized by the occurrence of multiple adnexal tumours, including cylindromas, trichoepitheliomas, and spiradenomas. Pilomatrixoma (Option B) are benign tumours derived from hair matrix cells, presenting as hard, subcutaneous nodules, typically on the face or upper limbs. Histologically, they are characterized by basaloid cells and ghost cells indicative of hair follicle differentiation. Syringomas (Option C) are benign tumours of eccrine sweat glands, typically presenting as multiple small, flesh-coloured to tan papules, often around the eyelids. Histologically, syringomas are characterized by comma-shaped or tadpole-like projections when viewed under a microscope. Trichilemmomas (Option D) are benign tumours arising from the outer root sheath of hair follicles, often appearing as flesh-coloured papules, commonly on the face. Histologically, they exhibit clear cells and peripheral palisading, resembling the outer root sheath."

        "answer": 2,
        "solution": "Correct Answer: B) Bullous Pemphigoid Bullous pemphigoid typically presents with tense blisters and is common in older adults. The blisters are subepidermal and characterized by linear IgG and complement deposition along the basement membrane on immunofluorescence, consistent with the findings in this case. Commonly seen in :   Flexor aspect of the forearm   Axilla   Groin Micrograph of bullous pemphigoid. Subepidermal blistering [solid arrows in (A,B)] and influx of inflammatory cells including eosinophils and neutrophils in the dermis [solid arrow (C)] and blister cavity [dashed arrows (C)]. In (C) also deposition of fibrin is noted (asterisks). Morphology:   The lesions are tense bullae filled with clear fluid involving erythematous or normal-appearing skin.   The bullae are usually less than 2 cm in diameter but occasionally may reach 4 to 8 cm in diameter.   They do not rupture easily, unlike the blisters seen in pemphigus, and heal without scarring unless they become infected secondarily. Pathogenesis:   Autoantibodies cause bullous pemphigoid, and most antibody deposition occurs in a continuous linear pattern at the dermo-epidermal junction, where specialized structures called hemidesmosomes link basal keratinocytes to the underlying basement membrane.   Bullous pemphigoid antigens (BPAGs) are components of hemidesmosomes.   Antibodies against one such component called BPAG2 are proven to cause blistering.   Pathogenic autoantibodies also activate complement, leading to the recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils, inflammation, and disruption of epidermal attachments.   A subepidermal split is seen. Under Immunofluorescence: Linear Immunofluorescence/ Ribbon candy appearance Linear deposition of complement along the dermo-epidermal junction in bullous pemphigoid Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (Option A): Typical presentation includes trauma-induced blistering, and direct immunofluorescence would show IgG targeting type VII collagen.

Pemphigus Vulgaris (Option C) is an autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by intraepithelial blisters and often presents with painful mucosal lesions. Direct immunofluorescence would show intercellular IgG deposits, which is not the case here. Dermatitis Herpetiformis (Option D) is associated with celiac disease and presents with grouped vesicles, often itchy, on extensor surfaces. Direct immunofluorescence shows granular IgA deposits at the dermal papillae. The patient’s presentation of tense blisters and the biopsy findings do not support this diagnosis."
